the odyssey
by homer
translated by samuel butler
book i.
tell me, o muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wideafter he had sacked the famous town of troy. many cities did he visit,and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he wasacquainted; moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to savehis own life and bring his men safely home; but do what he might hecould not save his men, for they perished through their own sheerfolly in eating the cattle of the sun-god hyperion; so the godprevented them from ever reaching home. tell me, too, about allthese things, o daughter of jove, from whatsoever source you mayknow them.
so now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had gotsafely home except ulysses, and he, though he was longing to return tohis wife and country, was detained by the goddess calypso, who had gothim into a large cave and wanted to marry him. but as years went by,there came a time when the gods settled that he should go back toithaca; even then, however, when he was among his own people, histroubles were not yet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun topity him except neptune, who still persecuted him without ceasingand would not let him get home.
now neptune had gone off to the ethiopians, who are at the world'send, and lie in two halves, the one looking west and the other east.he had gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and wasenjoying himself at his festival; but the other gods met in thehouse of olympian jove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. atthat moment he was thinking of aegisthus, who had been killed byagamemnon's son orestes; so he said to the other gods:
"see now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after allnothing but their own folly. look at aegisthus; he must needs makelove to agamemnon's wife unrighteously and then kill agamemnon, thoughhe knew it would be the death of him; for i sent mercury to warn himnot to do either of these things, inasmuch as orestes would be sure totake his revenge when he grew up and wanted to return home. mercurytold him this in all good will but he would not listen, and now he haspaid for everything in full."
then minerva said, "father, son of saturn, king of kings, itserved aegisthus right, and so it would any one else who does as hedid; but aegisthus is neither here nor there; it is for ulysses thatmy heart bleeds, when i think of his sufferings in that lonelysea-girt island, far away, poor man, from all his friends. it is anisland covered with forest, in the very middle of the sea, and agoddess lives there, daughter of the magician atlas, who looks afterthe bottom of the ocean, and carries the great columns that keepheaven and earth asunder. this daughter of atlas has got hold ofpoor unhappy ulysses, and keeps trying by every kind of blandishmentto make him forget his home, so that he is tired of life, and thinksof nothing but how he may once more see the smoke of his own chimneys.you, sir, take no heed of this, and yet when ulysses was before troydid he not propitiate you with many a burnt sacrifice? why then shouldyou keep on being so angry with him?"
and jove said, "my child, what are you talking about? how can iforget ulysses than whom there is no more capable man on earth, normore liberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live inheaven? bear in mind, however, that neptune is still furious withulysses for having blinded an eye of polyphemus king of thecyclopes. polyphemus is son to neptune by the nymph thoosa, daughterto the sea-king phorcys; therefore though he will not kill ulyssesoutright, he torments him by preventing him from getting home.still, let us lay our heads together and see how we can help him toreturn; neptune will then be pacified, for if we are all of a mindhe can hardly stand out against us."
and minerva said, "father, son of saturn, king of kings, if, then,the gods now mean that ulysses should get home, we should first sendmercury to the ogygian island to tell calypso that we have made up ourminds and that he is to return. in the meantime i will go to ithaca,to put heart into ulysses' son telemachus; i will embolden him to callthe achaeans in assembly, and speak out to the suitors of his motherpenelope, who persist in eating up any number of his sheep and oxen; iwill also conduct him to sparta and to pylos, to see if he can hearanything about the return of his dear father- for this will makepeople speak well of him."
so saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals,imperishable, with which she can fly like the wind over land or sea;she grasped the redoubtable bronze-shod spear, so stout and sturdy andstrong, wherewith she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeasedher, and down she darted from the topmost summits of olympus,whereon forthwith she was in ithaca, at the gateway of ulysses' house,disguised as a visitor, mentes, chief of the taphians, and she helda bronze spear in her hand. there she found the lordly suitorsseated on hides of the oxen which they had killed and eaten, andplaying draughts in front of the house. men-servants and pages werebustling about to wait upon them, some mixing wine with water in themixing-bowls, some cleaning down the tables with wet sponges andlaying them out again, and some cutting up great quantities of meat.
telemachus saw her long before any one else did. he was sittingmoodily among the suitors thinking about his brave father, and howhe would send them flying out of the house, if he were to come tohis own again and be honoured as in days gone by. thus brooding ashe sat among them, he caught sight of minerva and went straight to thegate, for he was vexed that a stranger should be kept waiting foradmittance. he took her right hand in his own, and bade her give himher spear. "welcome," said he, "to our house, and when you havepartaken of food you shall tell us what you have come for."
he led the way as he spoke, and minerva followed him. when they werewithin he took her spear and set it in the spear- stand against astrong bearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappyfather, and he conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which hethrew a cloth of damask. there was a footstool also for her feet,and he set another seat near her for himself, away from the suitors,that she might not be annoyed while eating by their noise andinsolence, and that he might ask her more freely about his father.
a maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewerand poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, andshe drew a clean table beside them. an upper servant brought thembread, and offered them many good things of what there was in thehouse, the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and setcups of gold by their side, and a man-servant brought them wine andpoured it out for them.
then the suitors came in and took their places on the benches andseats. forthwith men servants poured water over their hands, maidswent round with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowlswith wine and water, and they laid their hands upon the good thingsthat were before them. as soon as they had had enough to eat and drinkthey wanted music and dancing, which are the crowning embellishmentsof a banquet, so a servant brought a lyre to phemius, whom theycompelled perforce to sing to them. as soon as he touched his lyre andbegan to sing telemachus spoke low to minerva, with his head closeto hers that no man might hear.
"i hope, sir," said he, "that you will not be offended with what iam going to say. singing comes cheap to those who do not pay for it,and all this is done at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting insome wilderness or grinding to powder in the surf. if these men wereto see my father come back to ithaca they would pray for longer legsrather than a longer purse, for money would not serve them; but he,alas, has fallen on an ill fate, and even when people do sometimes saythat he is coming, we no longer heed them; we shall never see himagain. and now, sir, tell me and tell me true, who you are and whereyou come from. tell me of your town and parents, what manner of shipyou came in, how your crew brought you to ithaca, and of what nationthey declared themselves to be- for you cannot have come by land. tellme also truly, for i want to know, are you a stranger to this house,or have you been here in my father's time? in the old days we had manyvisitors for my father went about much himself."
and minerva answered, "i will tell you truly and particularly allabout it. i am mentes, son of anchialus, and i am king of thetaphians. i have come here with my ship and crew, on a voyage to menof a foreign tongue being bound for temesa with a cargo of iron, and ishall bring back copper. as for my ship, it lies over yonder off theopen country away from the town, in the harbour rheithron under thewooded mountain neritum. our fathers were friends before us, as oldlaertes will tell you, if you will go and ask him. they say,however, that he never comes to town now, and lives by himself inthe country, faring hardly, with an old woman to look after him andget his dinner for him, when he comes in tired from pottering abouthis vineyard. they told me your father was at home again, and that waswhy i came, but it seems the gods are still keeping him back, for heis not dead yet not on the mainland. it is more likely he is on somesea-girt island in mid ocean, or a prisoner among savages who aredetaining him against his will i am no prophet, and know very littleabout omens, but i speak as it is borne in upon me from heaven, andassure you that he will not be away much longer; for he is a man ofsuch resource that even though he were in chains of iron he would findsome means of getting home again. but tell me, and tell me true, canulysses really have such a fine looking fellow for a son? you areindeed wonderfully like him about the head and eyes, for we were closefriends before he set sail for troy where the flower of all theargives went also. since that time we have never either of us seen theother."
"my mother," answered telemachus, tells me i am son to ulysses,but it is a wise child that knows his own father. would that i wereson to one who had grown old upon his own estates, for, since youask me, there is no more ill-starred man under heaven than he who theytell me is my father."
and minerva said, "there is no fear of your race dying out yet,while penelope has such a fine son as you are. but tell me, and tellme true, what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are thesepeople? what is it all about? have you some banquet, or is there awedding in the family- for no one seems to be bringing anyprovisions of his own? and the guests- how atrociously they arebehaving; what riot they make over the whole house; it is enough todisgust any respectable person who comes near them."
"sir," said telemachus, "as regards your question, so long as myfather was here it was well with us and with the house, but the godsin their displeasure have willed it otherwise, and have hidden himaway more closely than mortal man was ever yet hidden. i could haveborne it better even though he were dead, if he had fallen with hismen before troy, or had died with friends around him when the daysof his fighting were done; for then the achaeans would have built amound over his ashes, and i should myself have been heir to hisrenown; but now the storm-winds have spirited him away we know notwither; he is gone without leaving so much as a trace behind him,and i inherit nothing but dismay. nor does the matter end simplywith grief for the loss of my father; heaven has laid sorrows uponme of yet another kind; for the chiefs from all our islands,dulichium, same, and the woodland island of zacynthus, as also all theprincipal men of ithaca itself, are eating up my house under thepretext of paying their court to my mother, who will neither pointblank say that she will not marry, nor yet bring matters to an end; sothey are making havoc of my estate, and before long will do so alsowith myself."
"is that so?" exclaimed minerva, "then you do indeed want ulysseshome again. give him his helmet, shield, and a couple lances, and ifhe is the man he was when i first knew him in our house, drinkingand making merry, he would soon lay his hands about these rascallysuitors, were he to stand once more upon his own threshold. he wasthen coming from ephyra, where he had been to beg poison for hisarrows from ilus, son of mermerus. ilus feared the ever-living godsand would not give him any, but my father let him have some, for hewas very fond of him. if ulysses is the man he then was thesesuitors will have a short shrift and a sorry wedding.
"but there! it rests with heaven to determine whether he is toreturn, and take his revenge in his own house or no; i would, however,urge you to set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once. takemy advice, call the achaean heroes in assembly to-morrow -lay yourcase before them, and call heaven to bear you witness. bid the suitorstake themselves off, each to his own place, and if your mother'smind is set on marrying again, let her go back to her father, who willfind her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that sodear a daughter may expect. as for yourself, let me prevail upon youto take the best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and goin quest of your father who has so long been missing. some one maytell you something, or (and people often hear things in this way) someheaven-sent message may direct you. first go to pylos and asknestor; thence go on to sparta and visit menelaus, for he got homelast of all the achaeans; if you hear that your father is alive and onhis way home, you can put up with the waste these suitors will makefor yet another twelve months. if on the other hand you hear of hisdeath, come home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all duepomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make your mother marryagain. then, having done all this, think it well over in your mindhow, by fair means or foul, you may kill these suitors in your ownhouse. you are too old to plead infancy any longer; have you not heardhow people are singing orestes' praises for having killed his father'smurderer aegisthus? you are a fine, smart looking fellow; show yourmettle, then, and make yourself a name in story. now, however, imust go back to my ship and to my crew, who will be impatient if ikeep them waiting longer; think the matter over for yourself, andremember what i have said to you."
"sir," answered telemachus, "it has been very kind of you to talk tome in this way, as though i were your own son, and i will do all youtell me; i know you want to be getting on with your voyage, but stay alittle longer till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself. iwill then give you a present, and you shall go on your wayrejoicing; i will give you one of great beauty and value- a keepsakesuch as only dear friends give to one another."
minerva answered, "do not try to keep me, for i would be on my wayat once. as for any present you may be disposed to make me, keep ittill i come again, and i will take it home with me. you shall giveme a very good one, and i will give you one of no less value inreturn."
with these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she hadgiven telemachus courage, and had made him think more than everabout his father. he felt the change, wondered at it, and knew thatthe stranger had been a god, so he went straight to where thesuitors were sitting.
phemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as hetold the sad tale of the return from troy, and the ills minerva hadlaid upon the achaeans. penelope, daughter of icarius, heard hissong from her room upstairs, and came down by the great staircase, notalone, but attended by two of her handmaids. when she reached thesuitors she stood by one of the bearing posts that supported theroof of the cloisters with a staid maiden on either side of her. sheheld a veil, moreover, before her face, and was weeping bitterly.
"phemius," she cried, "you know many another feat of gods andheroes, such as poets love to celebrate. sing the suitors some oneof these, and let them drink their wine in silence, but cease this sadtale, for it breaks my sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my losthusband whom i mourn ever without ceasing, and whose name was greatover all hellas and middle argos."
"mother," answered telemachus, "let the bard sing what he has a mindto; bards do not make the ills they sing of; it is jove, not they, whomakes them, and who sends weal or woe upon mankind according to hisown good pleasure. this fellow means no harm by singing theill-fated return of the danaans, for people always applaud thelatest songs most warmly. make up your mind to it and bear it; ulyssesis not the only man who never came back from troy, but many anotherwent down as well as he. go, then, within the house and busyyourself with your daily duties, your loom, your distaff, and theordering of your servants; for speech is man's matter, and mineabove all others- for it is i who am master here."
she went wondering back into the house, and laid her son's saying inher heart. then, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room,she mourned her dear husband till minerva shed sweet sleep over hereyes. but the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters,and prayed each one that he might be her bed fellow.
then telemachus spoke, "shameless," he cried, "and insolent suitors,let us feast at our pleasure now, and let there be no brawling, for itis a rare thing to hear a man with such a divine voice as phemius has;but in the morning meet me in full assembly that i may give you formalnotice to depart, and feast at one another's houses, turn and turnabout, at your own cost. if on the other hand you choose to persist inspunging upon one man, heaven help me, but jove shall reckon withyou in full, and when you fall in my father's house there shall beno man to avenge you."
the suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at theboldness of his speech. then, antinous, son of eupeithes, said, "thegods seem to have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking; mayjove never grant you to be chief in ithaca as your father was beforeyou."
telemachus answered, "antinous, do not chide with me, but, godwilling, i will be chief too if i can. is this the worst fate youcan think of for me? it is no bad thing to be a chief, for it bringsboth riches and honour. still, now that ulysses is dead there are manygreat men in ithaca both old and young, and some other may take thelead among them; nevertheless i will be chief in my own house, andwill rule those whom ulysses has won for me."
then eurymachus, son of polybus, answered, "it rests with heavento decide who shall be chief among us, but you shall be master in yourown house and over your own possessions; no one while there is a manin ithaca shall do you violence nor rob you. and now, my goodfellow, i want to know about this stranger. what country does hecome from? of what family is he, and where is his estate? has hebrought you news about the return of your father, or was he onbusiness of his own? he seemed a well-to-do man, but he hurried off sosuddenly that he was gone in a moment before we could get to knowhim."
"my father is dead and gone," answered telemachus, "and even if somerumour reaches me i put no more faith in it now. my mother does indeedsometimes send for a soothsayer and question him, but i give hisprophecyings no heed. as for the stranger, he was mentes, son ofanchialus, chief of the taphians, an old friend of my father's." butin his heart he knew that it had been the goddess.
the suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until theevening; but when night fell upon their pleasuring they went home tobed each in his own abode. telemachus's room was high up in a towerthat looked on to the outer court; hither, then, he hied, brooding andfull of thought. a good old woman, euryclea, daughter of ops, theson of pisenor, went before him with a couple of blazing torches.laertes had bought her with his own money when she was quite young; hegave the worth of twenty oxen for her, and shewed as much respect toher in his household as he did to his own wedded wife, but he didnot take her to his bed for he feared his wife's resentment. she itwas who now lighted telemachus to his room, and she loved him betterthan any of the other women in the house did, for she had nursed himwhen he was a baby. he opened the door of his bed room and sat downupon the bed; as he took off his shirt he gave it to the good oldwoman, who folded it tidily up, and hung it for him over a peg byhis bed side, after which she went out, pulled the door to by a silvercatch, and drew the bolt home by means of the strap. but telemachus ashe lay covered with a woollen fleece kept thinking all night throughof his intended voyage of the counsel that minerva had given him.
book ii.
now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared,telemachus rose and dressed himself. he bound his sandals on to hiscomely feet, girded his sword about his shoulder, and left his roomlooking like an immortal god. he at once sent the criers round to callthe people in assembly, so they called them and the people gatheredthereon; then, when they were got together, he went to the place ofassembly spear in hand- not alone, for his two hounds went with him.minerva endowed him with a presence of such divine comeliness that allmarvelled at him as he went by, and when he took his place' in hisfather's seat even the oldest councillors made way for him.
aegyptius, a man bent double with age, and of infinite experience,the first to speak his son antiphus had gone with ulysses to ilius,land of noble steeds, but the savage cyclops had killed him whenthey were all shut up in the cave, and had cooked his last dinnerfor him, he had three sons left, of whom two still worked on theirfather's land, while the third, eurynomus, was one of the suitors;nevertheless their father could not get over the loss of antiphus, andwas still weeping for him when he began his speech.
"men of ithaca," he said, "hear my words. from the day ulyssesleft us there has been no meeting of our councillors until now; whothen can it be, whether old or young, that finds it so necessary toconvene us? has he got wind of some host approaching, and does he wishto warn us, or would he speak upon some other matter of public moment?i am sure he is an excellent person, and i hope jove will grant himhis heart's desire."
telemachus took this speech as of good omen and rose at once, for hewas bursting with what he had to say. he stood in the middle of theassembly and the good herald pisenor brought him his staff. then,turning to aegyptius, "sir," said he, "it is i, as you will shortlylearn, who have convened you, for it is i who am the most aggrieved. ihave not got wind of any host approaching about which i would warnyou, nor is there any matter of public moment on which i wouldspeak. my grieveance is purely personal, and turns on two greatmisfortunes which have fallen upon my house. the first of these is theloss of my excellent father, who was chief among all you here present,and was like a father to every one of you; the second is much moreserious, and ere long will be the utter ruin of my estate. the sons ofall the chief men among you are pestering my mother to marry themagainst her will. they are afraid to go to her father icarius,asking him to choose the one he likes best, and to provide marriagegifts for his daughter, but day by day they keep hanging about myfather's house, sacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for theirbanquets, and never giving so much as a thought to the quantity ofwine they drink. no estate can stand such recklessness; we have now noulysses to ward off harm from our doors, and i cannot hold my ownagainst them. i shall never all my days be as good a man as he was,still i would indeed defend myself if i had power to do so, for icannot stand such treatment any longer; my house is being disgracedand ruined. have respect, therefore, to your own consciences and topublic opinion. fear, too, the wrath of heaven, lest the gods shouldbe displeased and turn upon you. i pray you by jove and themis, who isthe beginning and the end of councils, [do not] hold back, my friends,and leave me singlehanded- unless it be that my brave father ulyssesdid some wrong to the achaeans which you would now avenge on me, byaiding and abetting these suitors. moreover, if i am to be eaten outof house and home at all, i had rather you did the eatingyourselves, for i could then take action against you to somepurpose, and serve you with notices from house to house till i gotpaid in full, whereas now i have no remedy."
with this telemachus dashed his staff to the ground and burst intotears. every one was very sorry for him, but they all sat still and noone ventured to make him an angry answer, save only antinous, whospoke thus:
"telemachus, insolent braggart that you are, how dare you try tothrow the blame upon us suitors? it is your mother's fault not ours,for she is a very artful woman. this three years past, and close onfour, she has been driving us out of our minds, by encouraging eachone of us, and sending him messages without meaning one word of whatshe says. and then there was that other trick she played us. she setup a great tambour frame in her room, and began to work on an enormouspiece of fine needlework. 'sweet hearts,' said she, 'ulysses is indeeddead, still do not press me to marry again immediately, wait- for iwould not have skill in needlework perish unrecorded- till i havecompleted a pall for the hero laertes, to be in readiness againstthe time when death shall take him. he is very rich, and the womenof the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.'
"this was what she said, and we assented; whereon we could see herworking on her great web all day long, but at night she would unpickthe stitches again by torchlight. she fooled us in this way forthree years and we never found her out, but as time wore on and shewas now in her fourth year, one of her maids who knew what she wasdoing told us, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, soshe had to finish it whether she would or no. the suitors,therefore, make you this answer, that both you and the achaeans mayunderstand-'send your mother away, and bid her marry the man of herown and of her father's choice'; for i do not know what will happen ifshe goes on plaguing us much longer with the airs she gives herself onthe score of the accomplishments minerva has taught her, and becauseshe is so clever. we never yet heard of such a woman; we know allabout tyro, alcmena, mycene, and the famous women of old, but theywere nothing to your mother, any one of them. it was not fair of herto treat us in that way, and as long as she continues in the mind withwhich heaven has now endowed her, so long shall we go on eating upyour estate; and i do not see why she should change, for she getsall the honour and glory, and it is you who pay for it, not she.understand, then, that we will not go back to our lands, neitherhere nor elsewhere, till she has made her choice and married someone or other of us."
telemachus answered, "antinous, how can i drive the mother whobore me from my father's house? my father is abroad and we do not knowwhether he is alive or dead. it will be hard on me if i have to payicarius the large sum which i must give him if i insist on sending hisdaughter back to him. not only will he deal rigorously with me, butheaven will also punish me; for my mother when she leaves the housewill calf on the erinyes to avenge her; besides, it would not be acreditable thing to do, and i will have nothing to say to it. if youchoose to take offence at this, leave the house and feast elsewhere atone another's houses at your own cost turn and turn about. if, onthe other hand, you elect to persist in spunging upon one man,heaven help me, but jove shall reckon with you in full, and when youfall in my father's house there shall be no man to avenge you."
as he spoke jove sent two eagles from the top of the mountain, andthey flew on and on with the wind, sailing side by side in their ownlordly flight. when they were right over the middle of the assemblythey wheeled and circled about, beating the air with their wings andglaring death into the eyes of them that were below; then, fightingfiercely and tearing at one another, they flew off towards the rightover the town. the people wondered as they saw them, and asked eachother what an this might be; whereon halitherses, who was the bestprophet and reader of omens among them, spoke to them plainly and inall honesty, saying:
"hear me, men of ithaca, and i speak more particularly to thesuitors, for i see mischief brewing for them. ulysses is not goingto be away much longer; indeed he is close at hand to deal out deathand destruction, not on them alone, but on many another of us who livein ithaca. let us then be wise in time, and put a stop to thiswickedness before he comes. let the suitors do so of their own accord;it will be better for them, for i am not prophesying without dueknowledge; everything has happened to ulysses as i foretold when theargives set out for troy, and he with them. i said that after goingthrough much hardship and losing all his men he should come home againin the twentieth year and that no one would know him; and now all thisis coming true."
eurymachus son of polybus then said, "go home, old man, and prophesyto your own children, or it may be worse for them. i can read theseomens myself much better than you can; birds are always flying aboutin the sunshine somewhere or other, but they seldom mean anything.ulysses has died in a far country, and it is a pity you are not deadalong with him, instead of prating here about omens and adding fuel tothe anger of telemachus which is fierce enough as it is. i suppose youthink he will give you something for your family, but i tell you-and it shall surely be- when an old man like you, who should knowbetter, talks a young one over till he becomes troublesome, in thefirst place his young friend will only fare so much the worse- he willtake nothing by it, for the suitors will prevent this- and in thenext, we will lay a heavier fine, sir, upon yourself than you willat all like paying, for it will bear hardly upon you. as fortelemachus, i warn him in the presence of you all to send his motherback to her father, who will find her a husband and provide her withall the marriage gifts so dear a daughter may expect. till we shall goon harassing him with our suit; for we fear no man, and care neitherfor him, with all his fine speeches, nor for any fortune-telling ofyours. you may preach as much as you please, but we shall only hateyou the more. we shall go back and continue to eat up telemachus'sestate without paying him, till such time as his mother leaves offtormenting us by keeping us day after day on the tiptoe ofexpectation, each vying with the other in his suit for a prize of suchrare perfection. besides we cannot go after the other women whom weshould marry in due course, but for the way in which she treats us."
then telemachus said, "eurymachus, and you other suitors, i shallsay no more, and entreat you no further, for the gods and the peopleof ithaca now know my story. give me, then, a ship and a crew oftwenty men to take me hither and thither, and i will go to spartaand to pylos in quest of my father who has so long been missing.some one may tell me something, or (and people often hear things inthis way) some heaven-sent message may direct me. if i can hear of himas alive and on his way home i will put up with the waste yousuitors will make for yet another twelve months. if on the otherhand i hear of his death, i will return at once, celebrate his funeralrites with all due pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make mymother marry again."
with these words he sat down, and mentor who had been a friend ofulysses, and had been left in charge of everything with full authorityover the servants, rose to speak. he, then, plainly and in all honestyaddressed them thus:
"hear me, men of ithaca, i hope that you may never have a kind andwell-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern you equitably; ihope that all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust, forthere is not one of you but has forgotten ulysses, who ruled you asthough he were your father. i am not half so angry with the suitors,for if they choose to do violence in the naughtiness of theirhearts, and wager their heads that ulysses will not return, they cantake the high hand and eat up his estate, but as for you others i amshocked at the way in which you all sit still without even trying tostop such scandalous goings on-which you could do if you chose, foryou are many and they are few."
leiocritus, son of evenor, answered him saying, "mentor, whatfolly is all this, that you should set the people to stay us? it isa hard thing for one man to fight with many about his victuals. eventhough ulysses himself were to set upon us while we are feasting inhis house, and do his best to oust us, his wife, who wants him back sovery badly, would have small cause for rejoicing, and his bloodwould be upon his own head if he fought against such great odds. thereis no sense in what you have been saying. now, therefore, do youpeople go about your business, and let his father's old friends,mentor and halitherses, speed this boy on his journey, if he goes atall- which i do not think he will, for he is more likely to stay wherehe is till some one comes and tells him something."
on this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his ownabode, while the suitors returned to the house of ulysses.
then telemachus went all alone by the sea side, washed his handsin the grey waves, and prayed to minerva.
"hear me," he cried, "you god who visited me yesterday, and bademe sail the seas in search of my father who has so long beenmissing. i would obey you, but the achaeans, and more particularly thewicked suitors, are hindering me that i cannot do so."
as he thus prayed, minerva came close up to him in the likenessand with the voice of mentor. "telemachus," said she, "if you are madeof the same stuff as your father you will be neither fool nor cowardhenceforward, for ulysses never broke his word nor left his workhalf done. if, then, you take after him, your voyage will not befruitless, but unless you have the blood of ulysses and of penelope inyour veins i see no likelihood of your succeeding. sons are seldomas good men as their fathers; they are generally worse, not better;still, as you are not going to be either fool or cowardhenceforward, and are not entirely without some share of your father'swise discernment, i look with hope upon your undertaking. but mind younever make common cause with any of those foolish suitors, for theyhave neither sense nor virtue, and give no thought to death and to thedoom that will shortly fall on one and all of them, so that they shallperish on the same day. as for your voyage, it shall not be longdelayed; your father was such an old friend of mine that i will findyou a ship, and will come with you myself. now, however, returnhome, and go about among the suitors; begin getting provisions readyfor your voyage; see everything well stowed, the wine in jars, and thebarley meal, which is the staff of life, in leathern bags, while igo round the town and beat up volunteers at once. there are many shipsin ithaca both old and new; i will run my eye over them for you andwill choose the best; we will get her ready and will put out to seawithout delay."
thus spoke minerva daughter of jove, and telemachus lost no timein doing as the goddess told him. he went moodily and found thesuitors flaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer court. antinouscame up to him at once and laughed as he took his hand in his own,saying, "telemachus, my fine fire-eater, bear no more ill bloodneither in word nor deed, but eat and drink with us as you used to do.the achaeans will find you in everything- a ship and a picked crewto boot- so that you can set sail for pylos at once and get news ofyour noble father."
"antinous," answered telemachus, "i cannot eat in peace, nor takepleasure of any kind with such men as you are. was it not enoughthat you should waste so much good property of mine while i was yeta boy? now that i am older and know more about it, i am also stronger,and whether here among this people, or by going to pylos, i will doyou all the harm i can. i shall go, and my going will not be in vainthough, thanks to you suitors, i have neither ship nor crew of my own,and must be passenger not captain."
as he spoke he snatched his hand from that of antinous. meanwhilethe others went on getting dinner ready about the buildings, jeeringat him tauntingly as they did so.
"telemachus," said one youngster, "means to be the death of us; isuppose he thinks he can bring friends to help him from pylos, oragain from sparta, where he seems bent on going. or will he go toephyra as well, for poison to put in our wine and kill us?"
another said, "perhaps if telemachus goes on board ship, he willbe like his father and perish far from his friends. in this case weshould have plenty to do, for we could then divide up his propertyamongst us: as for the house we can let his mother and the man whomarries her have that."
this was how they talked. but telemachus went down into the loftyand spacious store-room where his father's treasure of gold and bronzelay heaped up upon the floor, and where the linen and spare clotheswere kept in open chests. here, too, there was a store of fragrantolive oil, while casks of old, well-ripened wine, unblended and fitfor a god to drink, were ranged against the wall in case ulyssesshould come home again after all. the room was closed with well-madedoors opening in the middle; moreover the faithful old house-keepereuryclea, daughter of ops the son of pisenor, was in charge ofeverything both night and day. telemachus called her to the store-roomand said:
"nurse, draw me off some of the best wine you have, after what youare keeping for my father's own drinking, in case, poor man, he shouldescape death, and find his way home again after all. let me havetwelve jars, and see that they all have lids; also fill me somewell-sewn leathern bags with barley meal- about twenty measures inall. get these things put together at once, and say nothing aboutit. i will take everything away this evening as soon as my motherhas gone upstairs for the night. i am going to sparta and to pylosto see if i can hear anything about the return of my dear father.
when euryclea heard this she began to cry, and spoke fondly tohim, saying, "my dear child, what ever can have put such notion asthat into your head? where in the world do you want to go to- you, whoare the one hope of the house? your poor father is dead and gone insome foreign country nobody knows where, and as soon as your back isturned these wicked ones here will be scheming to get you put out ofthe way, and will share all your possessions among themselves; staywhere you are among your own people, and do not go wandering andworrying your life out on the barren ocean."
"fear not, nurse," answered telemachus, "my scheme is not withoutheaven's sanction; but swear that you will say nothing about allthis to my mother, till i have been away some ten or twelve days,unless she hears of my having gone, and asks you; for i do not wanther to spoil her beauty by crying."
the old woman swore most solemnly that she would not, and when shehad completed her oath, she began drawing off the wine into jars,and getting the barley meal into the bags, while telemachus wentback to the suitors.
then minerva bethought her of another matter. she took his shape,and went round the town to each one of the crew, telling them tomeet at the ship by sundown. she went also to noemon son ofphronius, and asked him to let her have a ship- which he was veryready to do. when the sun had set and darkness was over all theland, she got the ship into the water, put all the tackle on board herthat ships generally carry, and stationed her at the end of theharbour. presently the crew came up, and the goddess spokeencouragingly to each of them.
furthermore she went to the house of ulysses, and threw thesuitors into a deep slumber. she caused their drink to fuddle them,and made them drop their cups from their hands, so that instead ofsitting over their wine, they went back into the town to sleep, withtheir eyes heavy and full of drowsiness. then she took the form andvoice of mentor, and called telemachus to come outside.
"telemachus," said she, "the men are on board and at their oars,waiting for you to give your orders, so make haste and let us be off."
on this she led the way, while telemachus followed in her steps.when they got to the ship they found the crew waiting by the waterside, and telemachus said, "now my men, help me to get the stores onboard; they are all put together in the cloister, and my mother doesnot know anything about it, nor any of the maid servants except one."
with these words he led the way and the others followed after.when they had brought the things as he told them, telemachus went onboard, minerva going before him and taking her seat in the stern ofthe vessel, while telemachus sat beside her. then the men loosed thehawsers and took their places on the benches. minerva sent them a fairwind from the west, that whistled over the deep blue waves whereontelemachus told them to catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail, andthey did as he told them. they set the mast in its socket in the crossplank, raised it, and made it fast with the forestays; then theyhoisted their white sails aloft with ropes of twisted ox hide. asthe sail bellied out with the wind, the ship flew through the deepblue water, and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward.then they made all fast throughout the ship, filled the mixing-bowlsto the brim, and made drink offerings to the immortal gods that arefrom everlasting, but more particularly to the grey-eyed daughter ofjove.
thus, then, the ship sped on her way through the watches of thenight from dark till dawn.
book iii.
but as the sun was rising from the fair sea into the firmament ofheaven to shed blight on mortals and immortals, they reached pylos thecity of neleus. now the people of pylos were gathered on the sea shoreto offer sacrifice of black bulls to neptune lord of the earthquake.there were nine guilds with five hundred men in each, and there werenine bulls to each guild. as they were eating the inward meats andburning the thigh bones [on the embers] in the name of neptune,telemachus and his crew arrived, furled their sails, brought theirship to anchor, and went ashore.
minerva led the way and telemachus followed her. presently she said,"telemachus, you must not be in the least shy or nervous; you havetaken this voyage to try and find out where your father is buriedand how he came by his end; so go straight up to nestor that we maysee what he has got to tell us. beg of him to speak the truth, andhe will tell no lies, for he is an excellent person."
"but how, mentor," replied telemachus, "dare i go up to nestor,and how am i to address him? i have never yet been used to holdinglong conversations with people, and am ashamed to begin questioningone who is so much older than myself."
"some things, telemachus," answered minerva, "will be suggested toyou by your own instinct, and heaven will prompt you further; for i amassured that the gods have been with you from the time of your birthuntil now."
she then went quickly on, and telemachus followed in her stepstill they reached the place where the guilds of the pylian people wereassembled. there they found nestor sitting with his sons, while hiscompany round him were busy getting dinner ready, and putting piecesof meat on to the spits while other pieces were cooking. when they sawthe strangers they crowded round them, took them by the hand andbade them take their places. nestor's son pisistratus at onceoffered his hand to each of them, and seated them on some softsheepskins that were lying on the sands near his father and hisbrother thrasymedes. then he gave them their portions of the inwardmeats and poured wine for them into a golden cup, handing it tominerva first, and saluting her at the same time.
"offer a prayer, sir," said he, "to king neptune, for it is hisfeast that you are joining; when you have duly prayed and made yourdrink-offering, pass the cup to your friend that he may do so also.i doubt not that he too lifts his hands in prayer, for man cannot livewithout god in the world. still he is younger than you are, and ismuch of an age with myself, so i he handed i will give you theprecedence."
as he spoke he handed her the cup. minerva thought it very right andproper of him to have given it to herself first; she accordingly beganpraying heartily to neptune. "o thou," she cried, "that encirclest theearth, vouchsafe to grant the prayers of thy servants that call uponthee. more especially we pray thee send down thy grace on nestor andon his sons; thereafter also make the rest of the pylian people somehandsome return for the goodly hecatomb they are offering you. lastly,grant telemachus and myself a happy issue, in respect of the matterthat has brought us in our to pylos."
when she had thus made an end of praying, she handed the cup totelemachus and he prayed likewise. by and by, when the outer meatswere roasted and had been taken off the spits, the carvers gaveevery man his portion and they all made an excellent dinner. as soonas they had had enough to eat and drink, nestor, knight of gerene,began to speak.
"now," said he, "that our guests have done their dinner, it willbe best to ask them who they are. who, then, sir strangers, are you,and from what port have you sailed? are you traders? or do you sailthe seas as rovers with your hand against every man, and every man'shand against you?"
telemachus answered boldly, for minerva had given him courage to askabout his father and get himself a good name.
"nestor," said he, "son of neleus, honour to the achaean name, youask whence we come, and i will tell you. we come from ithaca underneritum, and the matter about which i would speak is of private notpublic import. i seek news of my unhappy father ulysses, who is saidto have sacked the town of troy in company with yourself. we know whatfate befell each one of the other heroes who fought at troy, but asregards ulysses heaven has hidden from us the knowledge even that heis dead at all, for no one can certify us in what place he perished,nor say whether he fell in battle on the mainland, or was lost atsea amid the waves of amphitrite. therefore i am suppliant at yourknees, if haply you may be pleased to tell me of his melancholy end,whether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some othertraveller, for he was a man born to trouble. do not soften thingsout of any pity for me, but tell me in all plainness exactly whatyou saw. if my brave father ulysses ever did you loyal service, eitherby word or deed, when you achaeans were harassed among the trojans,bear it in mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all."
"my friend," answered nestor, "you recall a time of much sorrow tomy mind, for the brave achaeans suffered much both at sea, whileprivateering under achilles, and when fighting before the great cityof king priam. our best men all of them fell there- ajax, achilles,patroclus peer of gods in counsel, and my own dear son antilochus, aman singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. but we sufferedmuch more than this; what mortal tongue indeed could tell the wholestory? though you were to stay here and question me for five years, oreven six, i could not tell you all that the achaeans suffered, and youwould turn homeward weary of my tale before it ended. nine longyears did we try every kind of stratagem, but the hand of heaven wasagainst us; during all this time there was no one who could comparewith your father in subtlety- if indeed you are his son- i canhardly believe my eyes- and you talk just like him too- no one wouldsay that people of such different ages could speak so much alike. heand i never had any kind of difference from first to last neither incamp nor council, but in singleness of heart and purpose we advisedthe argives how all might be ordered for the best.
"when however, we had sacked the city of priam, and were settingsail in our ships as heaven had dispersed us, then jove saw fit to vexthe argives on their homeward voyage; for they had not all been eitherwise or understanding, and hence many came to a bad end through thedispleasure of jove's daughter minerva, who brought about a quarrelbetween the two sons of atreus.
"the sons of atreus called a meeting which was not as it shouldbe, for it was sunset and the achaeans were heavy with wine. when theyexplained why they had called- the people together, it seemed thatmenelaus was for sailing homeward at once, and this displeasedagamemnon, who thought that we should wait till we had offeredhecatombs to appease the anger of minerva. fool that he was, hemight have known that he would not prevail with her, for when the godshave made up their minds they do not change them lightly. so the twostood bandying hard words, whereon the achaeans sprang to their feetwith a cry that rent the air, and were of two minds as to what theyshould do.
"that night we rested and nursed our anger, for jove was hatchingmischief against us. but in the morning some of us drew our ships intothe water and put our goods with our women on board, while the rest,about half in number, stayed behind with agamemnon. we- the otherhalf- embarked and sailed; and the ships went well, for heaven hadsmoothed the sea. when we reached tenedos we offered sacrifices to thegods, for we were longing to get home; cruel jove, however, did notyet mean that we should do so, and raised a second quarrel in thecourse of which some among us turned their ships back again, andsailed away under ulysses to make their peace with agamemnon; but i,and all the ships that were with me pressed forward, for i saw thatmischief was brewing. the son of tydeus went on also with me, andhis crews with him. later on menelaus joined us at lesbos, and foundus making up our minds about our course- for we did not know whetherto go outside chios by the island of psyra, keeping this to ourleft, or inside chios, over against the stormy headland of mimas. sowe asked heaven for a sign, and were shown one to the effect that weshould be soonest out of danger if we headed our ships across the opensea to euboea. this we therefore did, and a fair wind sprang upwhich gave us a quick passage during the night to geraestus, wherewe offered many sacrifices to neptune for having helped us so far onour way. four days later diomed and his men stationed their ships inargos, but i held on for pylos, and the wind never fell light from theday when heaven first made it fair for me.
"therefore, my dear young friend, i returned without hearinganything about the others. i know neither who got home safely norwho were lost but, as in duty bound, i will give you without reservethe reports that have reached me since i have been here in my ownhouse. they say the myrmidons returned home safely under achilles' sonneoptolemus; so also did the valiant son of poias, philoctetes.idomeneus, again, lost no men at sea, and all his followers whoescaped death in the field got safe home with him to crete. nomatter how far out of the world you live, you will have heard ofagamemnon and the bad end he came to at the hands of aegisthus- anda fearful reckoning did aegisthus presently pay. see what a good thingit is for a man to leave a son behind him to do as orestes did, whokilled false aegisthus the murderer of his noble father. you too,then- for you are a tall, smart-looking fellow- show your mettle andmake yourself a name in story."
"nestor son of neleus," answered telemachus, "honour to theachaean name, the achaeans applaud orestes and his name will livethrough all time for he has avenged his father nobly. would thatheaven might grant me to do like vengeance on the insolence of thewicked suitors, who are ill treating me and plotting my ruin; butthe gods have no such happiness in store for me and for my father,so we must bear it as best we may."
"my friend," said nestor, "now that you remind me, i remember tohave heard that your mother has many suitors, who are ill disposedtowards you and are making havoc of your estate. do you submit to thistamely, or are public feeling and the voice of heaven against you? whoknows but what ulysses may come back after all, and pay thesescoundrels in full, either single-handed or with a force of achaeansbehind him? if minerva were to take as great a liking to you as shedid to ulysses when we were fighting before troy (for i never yetsaw the gods so openly fond of any one as minerva then was of yourfather), if she would take as good care of you as she did of him,these wooers would soon some of them him, forget their wooing."
telemachus answered, "i can expect nothing of the kind; it wouldbe far too much to hope for. i dare not let myself think of it. eventhough the gods themselves willed it no such good fortune could befallme."
on this minerva said, "telemachus, what are you talking about?heaven has a long arm if it is minded to save a man; and if it wereme, i should not care how much i suffered before getting home,provided i could be safe when i was once there. i would rather this,than get home quickly, and then be killed in my own house as agamemnonwas by the treachery of aegisthus and his wife. still, death iscertain, and when a man's hour is come, not even the gods can savehim, no matter how fond they are of him."
"mentor," answered telemachus, "do not let us talk about it anymore. there is no chance of my father's ever coming back; the godshave long since counselled his destruction. there is something else,however, about which i should like to ask nestor, for he knows muchmore than any one else does. they say he has reigned for threegenerations so that it is like talking to an immortal. tell me,therefore, nestor, and tell me true; how did agamemnon come to diein that way? what was menelaus doing? and how came false aegisthusto kill so far better a man than himself? was menelaus away fromachaean argos, voyaging elsewhither among mankind, that aegisthus tookheart and killed agamemnon?"
"i will tell you truly," answered nestor, "and indeed you haveyourself divined how it all happened. if menelaus when he got backfrom troy had found aegisthus still alive in his house, there wouldhave been no barrow heaped up for him, not even when he was dead,but he would have been thrown outside the city to dogs and vultures,and not a woman would have mourned him, for he had done a deed ofgreat wickedness; but we were over there, fighting hard at troy, andaegisthus who was taking his ease quietly in the heart of argos,cajoled agamemnon's wife clytemnestra with incessant flattery.
"at first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme, forshe was of a good natural disposition; moreover there was a bardwith her, to whom agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out fortroy, that he was to keep guard over his wife; but when heaven hadcounselled her destruction, aegisthus thus this bard off to a desertisland and left him there for crows and seagulls to batten upon- afterwhich she went willingly enough to the house of aegisthus. then heoffered many burnt sacrifices to the gods, and decorated manytemples with tapestries and gilding, for he had succeeded far beyondhis expectations.
"meanwhile menelaus and i were on our way home from troy, on goodterms with one another. when we got to sunium, which is the point ofathens, apollo with his painless shafts killed phrontis thesteersman of menelaus' ship (and never man knew better how to handle avessel in rough weather) so that he died then and there with thehelm in his hand, and menelaus, though very anxious to pressforward, had to wait in order to bury his comrade and give him his duefuneral rites. presently, when he too could put to sea again, andhad sailed on as far as the malean heads, jove counselled evil againsthim and made it it blow hard till the waves ran mountains high. herehe divided his fleet and took the one half towards crete where thecydonians dwell round about the waters of the river iardanus. there isa high headland hereabouts stretching out into the sea from a placecalled gortyn, and all along this part of the coast as far as phaestusthe sea runs high when there is a south wind blowing, but arterphaestus the coast is more protected, for a small headland can makea great shelter. here this part of the fleet was driven on to therocks and wrecked; but the crews just managed to save themselves. asfor the other five ships, they were taken by winds and seas toegypt, where menelaus gathered much gold and substance among people ofan alien speech. meanwhile aegisthus here at home plotted his evildeed. for seven years after he had killed agamemnon he ruled inmycene, and the people were obedient under him, but in the eighth yearorestes came back from athens to be his bane, and killed themurderer of his father. then he celebrated the funeral rites of hismother and of false aegisthus by a banquet to the people of argos, andon that very day menelaus came home, with as much treasure as hisships could carry.
"take my advice then, and do not go travelling about for long so farfrom home, nor leave your property with such dangerous people inyour house; they will eat up everything you have among them, and youwill have been on a fool's errand. still, i should advise you by allmeans to go and visit menelaus, who has lately come off a voyage amongsuch distant peoples as no man could ever hope to get back from,when the winds had once carried him so far out of his reckoning;even birds cannot fly the distance in a twelvemonth, so vast andterrible are the seas that they must cross. go to him, therefore, bysea, and take your own men with you; or if you would rather travelby land you can have a chariot, you can have horses, and here are mysons who can escort you to lacedaemon where menelaus lives. beg of himto speak the truth, and he will tell you no lies, for he is anexcellent person."
as he spoke the sun set and it came on dark, whereon minerva said,"sir, all that you have said is well; now, however, order thetongues of the victims to be cut, and mix wine that we may makedrink-offerings to neptune, and the other immortals, and then go tobed, for it is bed time. people should go away early and not keep latehours at a religious festival."
thus spoke the daughter of jove, and they obeyed her saying. menservants poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filledthe mixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after givingevery man his drink-offering; then they threw the tongues of thevictims into the fire, and stood up to make their drink-offerings.when they had made their offerings and had drunk each as much as hewas minded, minerva and telemachus were forgoing on board theirship, but nestor caught them up at once and stayed them.
"heaven and the immortal gods," he exclaimed, "forbid that youshould leave my house to go on board of a ship. do you think i am sopoor and short of clothes, or that i have so few cloaks and as to beunable to find comfortable beds both for myself and for my guests? letme tell you i have store both of rugs and cloaks, and shall not permitthe son of my old friend ulysses to camp down on the deck of a ship-not while i live- nor yet will my sons after me, but they will keepopen house as have done."
then minerva answered, "sir, you have spoken well, and it will bemuch better that telemachus should do as you have said; he, therefore,shall return with you and sleep at your house, but i must go back togive orders to my crew, and keep them in good heart. i am the onlyolder person among them; the rest are all young men of telemachus' ownage, who have taken this voyage out of friendship; so i must return tothe ship and sleep there. moreover to-morrow i must go to thecauconians where i have a large sum of money long owing to me. asfor telemachus, now that he is your guest, send him to lacedaemon in achariot, and let one of your sons go with him. be pleased also toprovide him with your best and fleetest horses."
when she had thus spoken, she flew away in the form of an eagle, andall marvelled as they beheld it. nestor was astonished, and tooktelemachus by the hand. "my friend," said he, "i see that you aregoing to be a great hero some day, since the gods wait upon you thuswhile you are still so young. this can have been none other of thosewho dwell in heaven than jove's redoubtable daughter, thetrito-born, who showed such favour towards your brave father among theargives." "holy queen," he continued, "vouchsafe to send down thygrace upon myself, my good wife, and my children. in return, i willoffer you in sacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a year old,unbroken, and never yet brought by man under the yoke. i will gild herhorns, and will offer her up to you in sacrifice."
thus did he pray, and minerva heard his prayer. he then led theway to his own house, followed by his sons and sons-in-law. whenthey had got there and had taken their places on the benches andseats, he mixed them a bowl of sweet wine that was eleven years oldwhen the housekeeper took the lid off the jar that held it. as hemixed the wine, he prayed much and made drink-offerings to minerva,daughter of aegis-bearing jove. then, when they had made theirdrink-offerings and had drunk each as much as he was minded, theothers went home to bed each in his own abode; but nestor puttelemachus to sleep in the room that was over the gateway along withpisistratus, who was the only unmarried son now left him. as forhimself, he slept in an inner room of the house, with the queen hiswife by his side.
now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared,nestor left his couch and took his seat on the benches of white andpolished marble that stood in front of his house. here aforetime satneleus, peer of gods in counsel, but he was now dead, and had goneto the house of hades; so nestor sat in his seat, sceptre in hand,as guardian of the public weal. his sons as they left their roomsgathered round him, echephron, stratius, perseus, aretus, andthrasymedes; the sixth son was pisistratus, and when telemachus joinedthem they made him sit with them. nestor then addressed them.
"my sons," said he, "make haste to do as i shall bid you. i wishfirst and foremost to propitiate the great goddess minerva, whomanifested herself visibly to me during yesterday's festivities. go,then, one or other of you to the plain, tell the stockman to look meout a heifer, and come on here with it at once. another must go totelemachus's ship, and invite all the crew, leaving two men only incharge of the vessel. some one else will run and fetch laerceus thegoldsmith to gild the horns of the heifer. the rest, stay all of youwhere you are; tell the maids in the house to prepare an excellentdinner, and to fetch seats, and logs of wood for a burnt offering.tell them also- to bring me some clear spring water."
on this they hurried off on their several errands. the heifer wasbrought in from the plain, and telemachus's crew came from the ship;the goldsmith brought the anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which heworked his gold, and minerva herself came to the sacrifice. nestorgave out the gold, and the smith gilded the horns of the heifer thatthe goddess might have pleasure in their beauty. then stratius andechephron brought her in by the horns; aretus fetched water from thehouse in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it, and in his other handhe held a basket of barley meal; sturdy thrasymedes stood by with asharp axe, ready to strike the heifer, while perseus held a bucket.then nestor began with washing his hands and sprinkling the barleymeal, and he offered many a prayer to minerva as he threw a lockfrom the heifer's head upon the fire.
when they had done praying and sprinkling the barley mealthrasymedes dealt his blow, and brought the heifer down with astroke that cut through the tendons at the base of her neck, whereonthe daughters and daughters-in-law of nestor, and his venerable wifeeurydice (she was eldest daughter to clymenus) screamed withdelight. then they lifted the heifer's head from off the ground, andpisistratus cut her throat. when she had done bleeding and was quitedead, they cut her up. they cut out the thigh bones all in due course,wrapped them round in two layers of fat, and set some pieces of rawmeat on the top of them; then nestor laid them upon the wood fireand poured wine over them, while the young men stood near him withfive-pronged spits in their hands. when the thighs were burned andthey had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest of the meat upsmall, put the pieces on the spits and toasted them over the fire.
meanwhile lovely polycaste, nestor's youngest daughter, washedtelemachus. when she had washed him and anointed him with oil, shebrought him a fair mantle and shirt, and he looked like a god as hecame from the bath and took his seat by the side of nestor. when theouter meats were done they drew them off the spits and sat down todinner where they were waited upon by some worthy henchmen, who keptpouring them out their wine in cups of gold. as soon as they had hadhad enough to eat and drink nestor said, "sons, put telemachus'shorses to the chariot that he may start at once."
thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said, and yoked thefleet horses to the chariot. the housekeeper packed them up aprovision of bread, wine, and sweetmeats fit for the sons ofprinces. then telemachus got into the chariot, while pisistratusgathered up the reins and took his seat beside him. he lashed thehorses on and they flew forward nothing loth into the open country,leaving the high citadel of pylos behind them. all that day did theytravel, swaying the yoke upon their necks till the sun went down anddarkness was over all the land. then they reached pherae where diocleslived, who was son to ortilochus and grandson to alpheus. here theypassed the night and diocles entertained them hospitably. when thechild of morning, rosy-fingered dawn; appeared, they again yoked theirhorses and drove out through the gateway under the echoinggatehouse. pisistratus lashed the horses on and they flew forwardnothing loth; presently they came to the corn lands of the opencountry, and in the course of time completed their journey, so welldid their steeds take them.
now when the sun had set and darkness was over the land.
book iv.
they reached the low lying city of lacedaemon them where theydrove straight to the of abode menelaus [and found him in his ownhouse, feasting with his many clansmen in honour of the wedding of hisson, and also of his daughter, whom he was marrying to the son of thatvaliant warrior achilles. he had given his consent and promised her tohim while he was still at troy, and now the gods were bringing themarriage about; so he was sending her with chariots and horses tothe city of the myrmidons over whom achilles' son was reigning. forhis only son he had found a bride from sparta, daughter of alector.this son, megapenthes, was born to him of a bondwoman, for heavenvouchsafed helen no more children after she had borne hermione, whowas fair as golden venus herself.
so the neighbours and kinsmen of menelaus were feasting and makingmerry in his house. there was a bard also to sing to them and play hislyre, while two tumblers went about performing in the midst of themwhen the man struck up with his tune.]
telemachus and the son of nestor stayed their horses at the gate,whereon eteoneus servant to menelaus came out, and as soon as he sawthem ran hurrying back into the house to tell his master. he wentclose up to him and said, "menelaus, there are some strangers comehere, two men, who look like sons of jove. what are we to do? shall wetake their horses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere asthey best can?"
menelaus was very angry and said, "eteoneus, son of boethous, younever used to be a fool, but now you talk like a simpleton. take theirhorses out, of course, and show the strangers in that they may havesupper; you and i have stayed often enough at other people's housesbefore we got back here, where heaven grant that we may rest inpeace henceforward."
so eteoneus bustled back and bade other servants come with him. theytook their sweating hands from under the yoke, made them fast to themangers, and gave them a feed of oats and barley mixed. then theyleaned the chariot against the end wall of the courtyard, and ledthe way into the house. telemachus and pisistratus were astonishedwhen they saw it, for its splendour was as that of the sun and moon;then, when they had admired everything to their heart's content,they went into the bath room and washed themselves.
when the servants had washed them and anointed them with oil, theybrought them woollen cloaks and shirts, and the two took their seatsby the side of menelaus. a maidservant brought them water in abeautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them towash their hands; and she drew a clean table beside them. an upperservant brought them bread, and offered them many good things ofwhat there was in the house, while the carver fetched them plates ofall manner of meats and set cups of gold by their side.
menelaus then greeted them saying, "fall to, and welcome; when youhave done supper i shall ask who you are, for the lineage of suchmen as you cannot have been lost. you must be descended from a line ofsceptre-bearing kings, for poor people do not have such sons as youare."
on this he handed them a piece of fat roast loin, which had been setnear him as being a prime part, and they laid their hands on thegood things that were before them; as soon as they had had enough toeat and drink, telemachus said to the son of nestor, with his headso close that no one might hear, "look, pisistratus, man after myown heart, see the gleam of bronze and gold- of amber, ivory, andsilver. everything is so splendid that it is like seeing the palace ofolympian jove. i am lost in admiration."
menelaus overheard him and said, "no one, my sons, can hold hisown with jove, for his house and everything about him is immortal; butamong mortal men- well, there may be another who has as much wealth asi have, or there may not; but at all events i have travelled muchand have undergone much hardship, for it was nearly eight years beforei could get home with my fleet. i went to cyprus, phoenicia and theegyptians; i went also to the ethiopians, the sidonians, and theerembians, and to libya where the lambs have horns as soon as they areborn, and the sheep lamb down three times a year. every one in thatcountry, whether master or man, has plenty of cheese, meat, and goodmilk, for the ewes yield all the year round. but while i wastravelling and getting great riches among these people, my brother wassecretly and shockingly murdered through the perfidy of his wickedwife, so that i have no pleasure in being lord of all this wealth.whoever your parents may be they must have told you about all this,and of my heavy loss in the ruin of a stately mansion fully andmagnificently furnished. would that i had only a third of what i nowhave so that i had stayed at home, and all those were living whoperished on the plain of troy, far from argos. i of grieve, as i sithere in my house, for one and all of them. at times i cry aloud forsorrow, but presently i leave off again, for crying is cold comfortand one soon tires of it. yet grieve for these as i may, i do so forone man more than for them all. i cannot even think of him withoutloathing both food and sleep, so miserable does he make me, for no oneof all the achaeans worked so hard or risked so much as he did. hetook nothing by it, and has left a legacy of sorrow to myself, forhe has been gone a long time, and we know not whether he is alive ordead. his old father, his long-suffering wife penelope, and his sontelemachus, whom he left behind him an infant in arms, are plungedin grief on his account."
thus spoke menelaus, and the heart of telemachus yearned as hebethought him of his father. tears fell from his eyes as he heardhim thus mentioned, so that he held his cloak before his face withboth hands. when menelaus saw this he doubted whether to let himchoose his own time for speaking, or to ask him at once and findwhat it was all about.
while he was thus in two minds helen came down from her high vaultedand perfumed room, looking as lovely as diana herself. adraste broughther a seat, alcippe a soft woollen rug while phylo fetched her thesilver work-box which alcandra wife of polybus had given her.polybus lived in egyptian thebes, which is the richest city in thewhole world; he gave menelaus two baths, both of pure silver, twotripods, and ten talents of gold; besides all this, his wife gavehelen some beautiful presents, to wit, a golden distaff, and asilver work-box that ran on wheels, with a gold band round the topof it. phylo now placed this by her side, full of fine spun yarn,and a distaff charged with violet coloured wool was laid upon thetop of it. then helen took her seat, put her feet upon thefootstool, and began to question her husband.
"do we know, menelaus," said she, "the names of these strangerswho have come to visit us? shall i guess right or wrong?-but icannot help saying what i think. never yet have i seen either man orwoman so like somebody else (indeed when i look at him i hardly knowwhat to think) as this young man is like telemachus, whom ulysses leftas a baby behind him, when you achaeans went to troy with battle inyour hearts, on account of my most shameless self."
"my dear wife," replied menelaus, "i see the likeness just as youdo. his hands and feet are just like ulysses'; so is his hair, withthe shape of his head and the expression of his eyes. moreover, when iwas talking about ulysses, and saying how much he had suffered on myaccount, tears fell from his eyes, and he hid his face in his mantle."
then pisistratus said, "menelaus, son of atreus, you are right inthinking that this young man is telemachus, but he is very modest, andis ashamed to come here and begin opening up discourse with onewhose conversation is so divinely interesting as your own. myfather, nestor, sent me to escort him hither, for he wanted to knowwhether you could give him any counsel or suggestion. a son has alwaystrouble at home when his father has gone away leaving him withoutsupporters; and this is how telemachus is now placed, for his fatheris absent, and there is no one among his own people to stand by him."
"bless my heart," replied menelaus, "then i am receiving a visitfrom the son of a very dear friend, who suffered much hardship formy sake. i had always hoped to entertain him with most markeddistinction when heaven had granted us a safe return from beyond theseas. i should have founded a city for him in argos, and built him ahouse. i should have made him leave ithaca with his goods, his son,and all his people, and should have sacked for them some one of theneighbouring cities that are subject to me. we should thus have seenone another continually, and nothing but death could haveinterrupted so close and happy an intercourse. i suppose, however,that heaven grudged us such great good fortune, for it has preventedthe poor fellow from ever getting home at all."
thus did he speak, and his words set them all a weeping. helen wept,telemachus wept, and so did menelaus, nor could pisistratus keep hiseyes from filling, when he remembered his dear brother antilochus whomthe son of bright dawn had killed. thereon he said to menelaus,
"sir, my father nestor, when we used to talk about you at home, toldme you were a person of rare and excellent understanding. if, then, itbe possible, do as i would urge you. i am not fond of crying while iam getting my supper. morning will come in due course, and in theforenoon i care not how much i cry for those that are dead and gone.this is all we can do for the poor things. we can only shave our headsfor them and wring the tears from our cheeks. i had a brother who diedat troy; he was by no means the worst man there; you are sure tohave known him- his name was antilochus; i never set eyes upon himmyself, but they say that he was singularly fleet of foot and in fightvaliant."
"your discretion, my friend," answered menelaus, "is beyond youryears. it is plain you take after your father. one can soon see when aman is son to one whom heaven has blessed both as regards wife andoffspring- and it has blessed nestor from first to last all hisdays, giving him a green old age in his own house, with sons about himwho are both we disposed and valiant. we will put an end thereforeto all this weeping, and attend to our supper again. let water bepoured over our hands. telemachus and i can talk with one anotherfully in the morning."
on this asphalion, one of the servants, poured water over theirhands and they laid their hands on the good things that were beforethem.
then jove's daughter helen bethought her of another matter. shedrugged the wine with an herb that banishes all care, sorrow, andill humour. whoever drinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tearall the rest of the day, not even though his father and mother both ofthem drop down dead, or he sees a brother or a son hewn in piecesbefore his very eyes. this drug, of such sovereign power and virtue,had been given to helen by polydamna wife of thon, a woman of egypt,where there grow all sorts of herbs, some good to put into themixing-bowl and others poisonous. moreover, every one in the wholecountry is a skilled physician, for they are of the race of paeeon.when helen had put this drug in the bowl, and had told the servants toserve the wine round, she said:
"menelaus, son of atreus, and you my good friends, sons ofhonourable men (which is as jove wills, for he is the giver both ofgood and evil, and can do what he chooses), feast here as you will,and listen while i tell you a tale in season. i cannot indeed nameevery single one of the exploits of ulysses, but i can say what he didwhen he was before troy, and you achaeans were in all sorts ofdifficulties. he covered himself with wounds and bruises, dressedhimself all in rags, and entered the enemy's city looking like amenial or a beggar. and quite different from what he did when he wasamong his own people. in this disguise he entered the city of troy,and no one said anything to him. i alone recognized him and began toquestion him, but he was too cunning for me. when, however, i hadwashed and anointed him and had given him clothes, and after i hadsworn a solemn oath not to betray him to the trojans till he had gotsafely back to his own camp and to the ships, he told me all thatthe achaeans meant to do. he killed many trojans and got muchinformation before he reached the argive camp, for all which thingsthe trojan women made lamentation, but for my own part i was glad, formy heart was beginning to oam after my home, and i was unhappy aboutwrong that venus had done me in taking me over there, away from mycountry, my girl, and my lawful wedded husband, who is indeed by nomeans deficient either in person or understanding."
then menelaus said, "all that you have been saying, my dear wife, istrue. i have travelled much, and have had much to do with heroes,but i have never seen such another man as ulysses. what endurance too,and what courage he displayed within the wooden horse, wherein all thebravest of the argives were lying in wait to bring death anddestruction upon the trojans. at that moment you came up to us; somegod who wished well to the trojans must have set you on to it andyou had deiphobus with you. three times did you go all round ourhiding place and pat it; you called our chiefs each by his own name,and mimicked all our wives -diomed, ulysses, and i from our seatsinside heard what a noise you made. diomed and i could not make up ourminds whether to spring out then and there, or to answer you frominside, but ulysses held us all in check, so we sat quite still, allexcept anticlus, who was beginning to answer you, when ulysses clappedhis two brawny hands over his mouth, and kept them there. it wasthis that saved us all, for he muzzled anticlus till minerva tookyou away again."
"how sad," exclaimed telemachus, "that all this was of no avail tosave him, nor yet his own iron courage. but now, sir, be pleased tosend us all to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon ofsleep."
on this helen told the maid servants to set beds in the room thatwas in the gatehouse, and to make them with good red rugs, andspread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for the gueststo wear. so the maids went out, carrying a torch, and made the beds,to which a man-servant presently conducted the strangers. thus,then, did telemachus and pisistratus sleep there in the forecourt,while the son of atreus lay in an inner room with lovely helen byhis side.
when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, menelausrose and dressed himself. he bound his sandals on to his comelyfeet, girded his sword about his shoulders, and left his roomlooking like an immortal god. then, taking a seat near telemachus hesaid:
"and what, telemachus, has led you to take this long sea voyage tolacedaemon? are you on public or private business? tell me all aboutit."
"i have come, sir replied telemachus, "to see if you can tell meanything about my father. i am being eaten out of house and home; myfair estate is being wasted, and my house is full of miscreants whokeep killing great numbers of my sheep and oxen, on the pretence ofpaying their addresses to my mother. therefore, i am suppliant at yourknees if haply you may tell me about my father's melancholy end,whether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some othertraveller; for he was a man born to trouble. do not soften thingsout of any pity for myself, but tell me in all plainness exactlywhat you saw. if my brave father ulysses ever did you loyal serviceeither by word or deed, when you achaeans were harassed by thetrojans, bear it in mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all."
menelaus on hearing this was very much shocked. "so," heexclaimed, "these cowards would usurp a brave man's bed? a hindmight as well lay her new born young in the lair of a lion, and thengo off to feed in the forest or in some grassy dell: the lion whenhe comes back to his lair will make short work with the pair ofthem- and so will ulysses with these suitors. by father jove, minerva,and apollo, if ulysses is still the man that he was when he wrestledwith philomeleides in lesbos, and threw him so heavily that all theachaeans cheered him- if he is still such and were to come nearthese suitors, they would have a short shrift and a sorry wedding.as regards your questions, however, i will not prevaricate nor deceiveyou, but will tell you without concealment all that the old man of thesea told me.
"i was trying to come on here, but the gods detained me in egypt,for my hecatombs had not given them full satisfaction, and the godsare very strict about having their dues. now off egypt, about as faras a ship can sail in a day with a good stiff breeze behind her, thereis an island called pharos- it has a good harbour from which vesselscan get out into open sea when they have taken in water- and thegods becalmed me twenty days without so much as a breath of fairwind to help me forward. we should have run clean out of provisionsand my men would have starved, if a goddess had not taken pity upon meand saved me in the person of idothea, daughter to proteus, the oldman of the sea, for she had taken a great fancy to me.
"she came to me one day when i was by myself, as i often was, forthe men used to go with their barbed hooks, all over the island in thehope of catching a fish or two to save them from the pangs ofhunger. 'stranger,' said she, 'it seems to me that you like starvingin this way- at any rate it does not greatly trouble you, for youstick here day after day, without even trying to get away thoughyour men are dying by inches.'
"'let me tell you,' said i, 'whichever of the goddesses you mayhappen to be, that i am not staying here of my own accord, but musthave offended the gods that live in heaven. tell me, therefore, forthe gods know everything. which of the immortals it is that ishindering me in this way, and tell me also how i may sail the sea soas to reach my home.'
"'stranger,' replied she, 'i will make it all quite clear to you.there is an old immortal who lives under the sea hereabouts andwhose name is proteus. he is an egyptian, and people say he is myfather; he is neptune's head man and knows every inch of ground allover the bottom of the sea. if you can snare him and hold him tight,he will tell you about your voyage, what courses you are to take,and how you are to sail the sea so as to reach your home. he will alsotell you, if you so will, all that has been going on at your houseboth good and bad, while you have been away on your long and dangerousjourney.'
"'can you show me,' said i, 'some stratagem by means of which imay catch this old god without his suspecting it and finding me out?for a god is not easily caught- not by a mortal man.'
"'stranger,' said she, 'i will make it all quite clear to you. aboutthe time when the sun shall have reached mid heaven, the old man ofthe sea comes up from under the waves, heralded by the west windthat furs the water over his head. as soon as he has come up he liesdown, and goes to sleep in a great sea cave, where the seals-halosydne's chickens as they call them- come up also from the greysea, and go to sleep in shoals all round him; and a very strong andfish-like smell do they bring with them. early to-morrow morning iwill take you to this place and will lay you in ambush. pick out,therefore, the three best men you have in your fleet, and i willtell you all the tricks that the old man will play you.
"'first he will look over all his seals, and count them; then,when he has seen them and tallied them on his five fingers, he will goto sleep among them, as a shepherd among his sheep. the moment you seethat he is asleep seize him; put forth all your strength and holdhim fast, for he will do his very utmost to get away from you. he willturn himself into every kind of creature that goes upon the earth, andwill become also both fire and water; but you must hold him fast andgrip him tighter and tighter, till he begins to talk to you andcomes back to what he was when you saw him go to sleep; then you mayslacken your hold and let him go; and you can ask him which of thegods it is that is angry with you, and what you must do to reachyour home over the seas.'
"having so said she dived under the waves, whereon i turned backto the place where my ships were ranged upon the shore; and my heartwas clouded with care as i went along. when i reached my ship we gotsupper ready, for night was falling, and camped down upon the beach.
"when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, i took thethree men on whose prowess of all kinds i could most rely, and wentalong by the sea-side, praying heartily to heaven. meanwhile thegoddess fetched me up four seal skins from the bottom of the sea,all of them just skinned, for she meant playing a trick upon herfather. then she dug four pits for us to lie in, and sat down towait till we should come up. when we were close to her, she made uslie down in the pits one after the other, and threw a seal skin overeach of us. our ambuscade would have been intolerable, for thestench of the fishy seals was most distressing- who would go to bedwith a sea monster if he could help it?-but here, too, the goddesshelped us, and thought of something that gave us great relief, for sheput some ambrosia under each man's nostrils, which was so fragrantthat it killed the smell of the seals.
"we waited the whole morning and made the best of it, watching theseals come up in hundreds to bask upon the sea shore, till at noon theold man of the sea came up too, and when he had found his fat seals hewent over them and counted them. we were among the first he counted,and he never suspected any guile, but laid himself down to sleep assoon as he had done counting. then we rushed upon him with a shout andseized him; on which he began at once with his old tricks, and changedhimself first into a lion with a great mane; then all of a sudden hebecame a dragon, a leopard, a wild boar; the next moment he wasrunning water, and then again directly he was a tree, but we stuckto him and never lost hold, till at last the cunning old creaturebecame distressed, and said, which of the gods was it, son ofatreus, that hatched this plot with you for snaring me and seizingme against my will? what do you want?'
"'you know that yourself, old man,' i answered, 'you will gainnothing by trying to put me off. it is because i have been kept solong in this island, and see no sign of my being able to get away. iam losing all heart; tell me, then, for you gods know everything,which of the immortals it is that is hindering me, and tell me alsohow i may sail the sea so as to reach my home?'
"then,' he said, 'if you would finish your voyage and get homequickly, you must offer sacrifices to jove and to the rest of the godsbefore embarking; for it is decreed that you shall not get back toyour friends, and to your own house, till you have returned to theheaven fed stream of egypt, and offered holy hecatombs to the immortalgods that reign in heaven. when you have done this they will let youfinish your voyage.'
"i was broken hearted when i heard that i must go back all that longand terrible voyage to egypt; nevertheless, i answered, 'i will doall, old man, that you have laid upon me; but now tell me, and tell metrue, whether all the achaeans whom nestor and i left behind us whenwe set sail from troy have got home safely, or whether any one of themcame to a bad end either on board his own ship or among his friendswhen the days of his fighting were done.'
"'son of atreus,' he answered, 'why ask me? you had better notknow what i can tell you, for your eyes will surely fill when you haveheard my story. many of those about whom you ask are dead and gone,but many still remain, and only two of the chief men among theachaeans perished during their return home. as for what happened onthe field of battle- you were there yourself. a third achaean leaderis still at sea, alive, but hindered from returning. ajax was wrecked,for neptune drove him on to the great rocks of gyrae; nevertheless, helet him get safe out of the water, and in spite of all minerva'shatred he would have escaped death, if he had not ruined himself byboasting. he said the gods could not drown him even though they hadtried to do so, and when neptune heard this large talk, he seizedhis trident in his two brawny hands, and split the rock of gyrae intwo pieces. the base remained where it was, but the part on which ajaxwas sitting fell headlong into the sea and carried ajax with it; so hedrank salt water and was drowned.
"'your brother and his ships escaped, for juno protected him, butwhen he was just about to reach the high promontory of malea, he wascaught by a heavy gale which carried him out to sea again sorelyagainst his will, and drove him to the foreland where thyestes used todwell, but where aegisthus was then living. by and by, however, itseemed as though he was to return safely after all, for the godsbacked the wind into its old quarter and they reached home; whereonagamemnon kissed his native soil, and shed tears of joy at findinghimself in his own country.
"'now there was a watchman whom aegisthus kept always on thewatch, and to whom he had promised two talents of gold. this man hadbeen looking out for a whole year to make sure that agamemnon didnot give him the slip and prepare war; when, therefore, this man sawagamemnon go by, he went and told aegisthus who at once began to lay aplot for him. he picked twenty of his bravest warriors and placed themin ambuscade on one side the cloister, while on the opposite side heprepared a banquet. then he sent his chariots and horsemen toagamemnon, and invited him to the feast, but he meant foul play. hegot him there, all unsuspicious of the doom that was awaiting him, andkilled him when the banquet was over as though he were butchering anox in the shambles; not one of agamemnon's followers was left alive,nor yet one of aegisthus', but they were all killed there in thecloisters.'
"thus spoke proteus, and i was broken hearted as i heard him. isat down upon the sands and wept; i felt as though i could no longerbear to live nor look upon the light of the sun. presently, when i hadhad my fill of weeping and writhing upon the ground, the old man ofthe sea said, 'son of atreus, do not waste any more time in cryingso bitterly; it can do no manner of good; find your way home as fastas ever you can, for aegisthus be still alive, and even though oresteshas beforehand with you in kilting him, you may yet come in for hisfuneral.'
"on this i took comfort in spite of all my sorrow, and said, 'iknow, then, about these two; tell me, therefore, about the third manof whom you spoke; is he still alive, but at sea, and unable to gethome? or is he dead? tell me, no matter how much it may grieve me.'
"'the third man,' he answered, 'is ulysses who dwells in ithaca. ican see him in an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of thenymph calypso, who is keeping him prisoner, and he cannot reach hishome for he has no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea. asfor your own end, menelaus, you shall not die in argos, but the godswill take you to the elysian plain, which is at the ends of the world.there fair-haired rhadamanthus reigns, and men lead an easier lifethan any where else in the world, for in elysium there falls not rain,nor hail, nor snow, but oceanus breathes ever with a west wind thatsings softly from the sea, and gives fresh life to all men. thiswill happen to you because you have married helen, and are jove'sson-in-law.'
"as he spoke he dived under the waves, whereon i turned back tothe ships with my companions, and my heart was clouded with care asi went along. when we reached the ships we got supper ready, for nightwas falling, and camped down upon the beach. when the child ofmorning, rosy-fingered dawn appeared, we drew our ships into thewater, and put our masts and sails within them; then we went onboard ourselves, took our seats on the benches, and smote the grey seawith our oars. i again stationed my ships in the heaven-fed streamof egypt, and offered hecatombs that were full and sufficient. wheni had thus appeased heaven's anger, i raised a barrow to the memory ofagamemnon that his name might live for ever, after which i had a quickpassage home, for the gods sent me a fair wind.
"and now for yourself- stay here some ten or twelve days longer, andi will then speed you on your way. i will make you a noble presentof a chariot and three horses. i will also give you a beautifulchalice that so long as you live you may think of me whenever you makea drink-offering to the immortal gods."
"son of atreus," replied telemachus, "do not press me to staylonger; i should be contented to remain with you for another twelvemonths; i find your conversation so delightful that i should neveronce wish myself at home with my parents; but my crew whom i have leftat pylos are already impatient, and you are detaining me from them. asfor any present you may be disposed to make me, i had rather that itshould he a piece of plate. i will take no horses back with me toithaca, but will leave them to adorn your own stables, for you havemuch flat ground in your kingdom where lotus thrives, as alsomeadowsweet and wheat and barley, and oats with their white andspreading ears; whereas in ithaca we have neither open fields norracecourses, and the country is more fit for goats than horses, andi like it the better for that. none of our islands have much levelground, suitable for horses, and ithaca least of all."
menelaus smiled and took telemachus's hand within his own. "what yousay," said he, "shows that you come of good family. i both can, andwill, make this exchange for you, by giving you the finest and mostprecious piece of plate in all my house. it is a mixing-bowl byvulcan's own hand, of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaidwith gold. phaedimus, king of the sidonians, gave it me in thecourse of a visit which i paid him when i returned thither on myhomeward journey. i will make you a present of it."
thus did they converse [and guests kept coming to the king'shouse. they brought sheep and wine, while their wives had put up breadfor them to take with them; so they were busy cooking their dinners inthe courts].
meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs or aiming with spears at amark on the levelled ground in front of ulysses' house, and werebehaving with all their old insolence. antinous and eurymachus, whowere their ringleaders and much the foremost among them all, weresitting together when noemon son of phronius came up and said toantinous,
"have we any idea, antinous, on what day telemachus returns frompylos? he has a ship of mine, and i want it, to cross over to elis:i have twelve brood mares there with yearling mule foals by their sidenot yet broken in, and i want to bring one of them over here and breakhim."
they were astounded when they heard this, for they had made surethat telemachus had not gone to the city of neleus. they thought hewas only away somewhere on the farms, and was with the sheep, orwith the swineherd; so antinous said, "when did he go? tell metruly, and what young men did he take with him? were they freemen orhis own bondsmen- for he might manage that too? tell me also, didyou let him have the ship of your own free will because he askedyou, or did he take it without yourleave?"
"i lent it him," answered noemon, "what else could i do when a manof his position said he was in a difficulty, and asked me to obligehim? i could not possibly refuse. as for those who went with himthey were the best young men we have, and i saw mentor go on boardas captain- or some god who was exactly like him. i cannotunderstand it, for i saw mentor here myself yesterday morning, and yethe was then setting out for pylos."
noemon then went back to his father's house, but antinous andeurymachus were very angry. they told the others to leave off playing,and to come and sit down along with themselves. when they came,antinous son of eupeithes spoke in anger. his heart was black withrage, and his eyes flashed fire as he said:
"good heavens, this voyage of telemachus is a very serious matter;we had made sure that it would come to nothing, but the young fellowhas got away in spite of us, and with a picked crew too. he will begiving us trouble presently; may jove take him before he is fullgrown. find me a ship, therefore, with a crew of twenty men, and iwill lie in wait for him in the straits between ithaca and samos; hewill then rue the day that he set out to try and get news of hisfather."
thus did he speak, and the others applauded his saying; they thenall of them went inside the buildings.
it was not long ere penelope came to know what the suitors wereplotting; for a man servant, medon, overheard them from outside theouter court as they were laying their schemes within, and went to tellhis mistress. as he crossed the threshold of her room penelope said:"medon, what have the suitors sent you here for? is it to tell themaids to leave their master's business and cook dinner for them? iwish they may neither woo nor dine henceforward, neither here noranywhere else, but let this be the very last time, for the waste youall make of my son's estate. did not your fathers tell you when youwere children how good ulysses had been to them- never doinganything high-handed, nor speaking harshly to anybody? kings may saythings sometimes, and they may take a fancy to one man and dislikeanother, but ulysses never did an unjust thing by anybody- which showswhat bad hearts you have, and that there is no such thing as gratitudeleft in this world."
then medon said, "i wish, madam, that this were all; but they areplotting something much more dreadful now- may heaven frustratetheir design. they are going to try and murder telemachus as he iscoming home from pylos and lacedaemon, where he has been to get newsof his father."
then penelope's heart sank within her, and for a long time she wasspeechless; her eyes filled with tears, and she could find noutterance. at last, however, she said, "why did my son leave me?what business had he to go sailing off in ships that make long voyagesover the ocean like sea-horses? does he want to die without leavingany one behind him to keep up his name?"
"i do not know," answered medon, "whether some god set him on to it,or whether he went on his own impulse to see if he could find out ifhis father was dead, or alive and on his way home."
then he went downstairs again, leaving penelope in an agony ofgrief. there were plenty of seats in the house, but she. had noheart for sitting on any one of them; she could only fling herselfon the floor of her own room and cry; whereon all the maids in thehouse, both old and young, gathered round her and began to cry too,till at last in a transport of sorrow she exclaimed,
"my dears, heaven has been pleased to try me with more afflictionthan any other woman of my age and country. first i lost my braveand lion-hearted husband, who had every good quality under heaven, andwhose name was great over all hellas and middle argos, and now mydarling son is at the mercy of the winds and waves, without myhaving heard one word about his leaving home. you hussies, there wasnot one of you would so much as think of giving me a call out of mybed, though you all of you very well knew when he was starting. if ihad known he meant taking this voyage, he would have had to give itup, no matter how much he was bent upon it, or leave me a corpsebehind him- one or other. now, however, go some of you and call olddolius, who was given me by my father on my marriage, and who is mygardener. bid him go at once and tell everything to laertes, who maybe able to hit on some plan for enlisting public sympathy on our side,as against those who are trying to exterminate his own race and thatof ulysses."
then the dear old nurse euryclea said, "you may kill me, madam, orlet me live on in your house, whichever you please, but i will tellyou the real truth. i knew all about it, and gave him everything hewanted in the way of bread and wine, but he made me take my solemnoath that i would not tell you anything for some ten or twelve days,unless you asked or happened to hear of his having gone, for he didnot want you to spoil your beauty by crying. and now, madam, wash yourface, change your dress, and go upstairs with your maids to offerprayers to minerva, daughter of aegis-bearing jove, for she can savehim even though he be in the jaws of death. do not trouble laertes: hehas trouble enough already. besides, i cannot think that the gods hatedie race of the race of the son of arceisius so much, but there willbe a son left to come up after him, and inherit both the house and thefair fields that lie far all round it."
with these words she made her mistress leave off crying, and driedthe tears from her eyes. penelope washed her face, changed herdress, and went upstairs with her maids. she then put some bruisedbarley into a basket and began praying to minerva.
"hear me," she cried, "daughter of aegis-bearing jove,unweariable. if ever ulysses while he was here burned you fat thighbones of sheep or heifer, bear it in mind now as in my favour, andsave my darling son from the villainy of the suitors."
she cried aloud as she spoke, and the goddess heard her prayer;meanwhile the suitors were clamorous throughout the coveredcloister, and one of them said:
"the queen is preparing for her marriage with one or other of us.little does she dream that her son has now been doomed to die."
this was what they said, but they did not know what was going tohappen. then antinous said, "comrades, let there be no loud talking,lest some of it get carried inside. let us be up and do that insilence, about which we are all of a mind."
he then chose twenty men, and they went down to their. ship and tothe sea side; they drew the vessel into the water and got her mast andsails inside her; they bound the oars to the thole-pins with twistedthongs of leather, all in due course, and spread the white sailsaloft, while their fine servants brought them their armour. thenthey made the ship fast a little way out, came on shore again, gottheir suppers, and waited till night should fall.
but penelope lay in her own room upstairs unable to eat or drink,and wondering whether her brave son would escape, or be overpowered bythe wicked suitors. like a lioness caught in the toils with huntsmenhemming her in on every side she thought and thought till she sankinto a slumber, and lay on her bed bereft of thought and motion.
then minerva bethought her of another matter, and made a vision inthe likeness of penelope's sister iphthime daughter of icarius who hadmarried eumelus and lived in pherae. she told the vision to go tothe house of ulysses, and to make penelope leave off crying, so itcame into her room by the hole through which the thong went forpulling the door to, and hovered over her head, saying,
"you are asleep, penelope: the gods who live at ease will not sufferyou to weep and be so sad. your son has done them no wrong, so he willyet come back to you."
penelope, who was sleeping sweetly at the gates of dreamland,answered, "sister, why have you come here? you do not come very often,but i suppose that is because you live such a long way off. am i,then, to leave off crying and refrain from all the sad thoughts thattorture me? i, who have lost my brave and lion-hearted husband, whohad every good quality under heaven, and whose name was great over allhellas and middle argos; and now my darling son has gone off onboard of a ship- a foolish fellow who has never been used toroughing it, nor to going about among gatherings of men. i am evenmore anxious about him than about my husband; i am all in a tremblewhen i think of him, lest something should happen to him, eitherfrom the people among whom he has gone, or by sea, for he has manyenemies who are plotting against him, and are bent on killing himbefore he can return home."
then the vision said, "take heart, and be not so much dismayed.there is one gone with him whom many a man would be glad enough tohave stand by his side, i mean minerva; it is she who has compassionupon you, and who has sent me to bear you this message."
"then," said penelope, "if you are a god or have been sent here bydivine commission, tell me also about that other unhappy one- is hestill alive, or is he already dead and in the house of hades?"
and the vision said, "i shall not tell you for certain whether he isalive or dead, and there is no use in idle conversation."
then it vanished through the thong-hole of the door and wasdissipated into thin air; but penelope rose from her sleep refreshedand comforted, so vivid had been her dream.
meantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over thesea, intent on murdering telemachus. now there is a rocky islet calledasteris, of no great size, in mid channel between ithaca and samos,and there is a harbour on either side of it where a ship can lie. herethen the achaeans placed themselves in ambush.
book v.
and now, as dawn rose from her couch beside tithonus- harbinger oflight alike to mortals and immortals- the gods met in council and withthem, jove the lord of thunder, who is their king. thereon minervabegan to tell them of the many sufferings of ulysses, for she pitiedhim away there in the house of the nymph calypso.
"father jove," said she, "and all you other gods that live ineverlasting bliss, i hope there may never be such a thing as a kindand well-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern equitably. ihope they will be all henceforth cruel and unjust, for there is notone of his subjects but has forgotten ulysses, who ruled them asthough he were their father. there he is, lying in great pain in anisland where dwells the nymph calypso, who will not let him go; and hecannot get back to his own country, for he can find neither shipsnor sailors to take him over the sea. furthermore, wicked people arenow trying to murder his only son telemachus, who is coming homefrom pylos and lacedaemon, where he has been to see if he can get newsof his father."
"what, my dear, are you talking about?" replied her father, "did younot send him there yourself, because you thought it would help ulyssesto get home and punish the suitors? besides, you are perfectly able toprotect telemachus, and to see him safely home again, while thesuitors have to come hurry-skurrying back without having killed him."
when he had thus spoken, he said to his son mercury, "mercury, youare our messenger, go therefore and tell calypso we have decreedthat poor ulysses is to return home. he is to be convoyed neither bygods nor men, but after a perilous voyage of twenty days upon a rafthe is to reach fertile scheria, the land of the phaeacians, who arenear of kin to the gods, and will honour him as though he were oneof ourselves. they will send him in a ship to his own country, andwill give him more bronze and gold and raiment than he would havebrought back from troy, if he had had had all his prize money andhad got home without disaster. this is how we have settled that heshall return to his country and his friends."
thus he spoke, and mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of argus, didas he was told. forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandalswith which he could fly like the wind over land and sea. he took thewand with which he seals men's eyes in sleep or wakes them just ashe pleases, and flew holding it in his hand over pieria; then heswooped down through the firmament till he reached the level of thesea, whose waves he skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishingevery hole and corner of the ocean, and drenching its thick plumage inthe spray. he flew and flew over many a weary wave, but when at lasthe got to the island which was his journey's end, he left the seaand went on by land till he came to the cave where the nymph calypsolived.
he found her at home. there was a large fire burning on thehearth, and one could smell from far the fragrant reek of burningcedar and sandal wood. as for herself, she was busy at her loom,shooting her golden shuttle through the warp and singingbeautifully. round her cave there was a thick wood of alder, poplar,and sweet smelling cypress trees, wherein all kinds of great birds hadbuilt their nests- owls, hawks, and chattering sea-crows that occupytheir business in the waters. a vine loaded with grapes was trainedand grew luxuriantly about the mouth of the cave; there were also fourrunning rills of water in channels cut pretty close together, andturned hither and thither so as to irrigate the beds of violets andluscious herbage over which they flowed. even a god could not helpbeing charmed with such a lovely spot, so mercury stood still andlooked at it; but when he had admired it sufficiently he went insidethe cave.
calypso knew him at once- for the gods all know each other, nomatter how far they live from one another- but ulysses was not within;he was on the sea-shore as usual, looking out upon the barren oceanwith tears in his eyes, groaning and breaking his heart for sorrow.calypso gave mercury a seat and said: "why have you come to see me,mercury- honoured, and ever welcome- for you do not visit me often?say what you want; i will do it for be you at once if i can, and if itcan be done at all; but come inside, and let me set refreshment beforeyou.
as she spoke she drew a table loaded with ambrosia beside him andmixed him some red nectar, so mercury ate and drank till he had hadenough, and then said:
"we are speaking god and goddess to one another, one another, andyou ask me why i have come here, and i will tell you truly as youwould have me do. jove sent me; it was no doing of mine; who couldpossibly want to come all this way over the sea where there are nocities full of people to offer me sacrifices or choice hecatombs?nevertheless i had to come, for none of us other gods can crossjove, nor transgress his orders. he says that you have here the mostill-starred of alf those who fought nine years before the city of kingpriam and sailed home in the tenth year after having sacked it. ontheir way home they sinned against minerva, who raised both wind andwaves against them, so that all his brave companions perished, andhe alone was carried hither by wind and tide. jove says that you areto let this by man go at once, for it is decreed that he shall notperish here, far from his own people, but shall return to his houseand country and see his friends again."
calypso trembled with rage when she heard this, "you gods," sheexclaimed, to be ashamed of yourselves. you are always jealous andhate seeing a goddess take a fancy to a mortal man, and live withhim in open matrimony. so when rosy-fingered dawn made love toorion, you precious gods were all of you furious till diana went andkilled him in ortygia. so again when ceres fell in love with iasion,and yielded to him in a thrice ploughed fallow field, jove came tohear of it before so long and killed iasion with his thunder-bolts.and now you are angry with me too because i have a man here. i foundthe poor creature sitting all alone astride of a keel, for jove hadstruck his ship with lightning and sunk it in mid ocean, so that allhis crew were drowned, while he himself was driven by wind and waveson to my island. i got fond of him and cherished him, and had set myheart on making him immortal, so that he should never grow old all hisdays; still i cannot cross jove, nor bring his counsels to nothing;therefore, if he insists upon it, let the man go beyond the seasagain; but i cannot send him anywhere myself for i have neitherships nor men who can take him. nevertheless i will readily give himsuch advice, in all good faith, as will be likely to bring himsafely to his own country."
"then send him away," said mercury, "or jove will be angry withyou and punish you"'
on this he took his leave, and calypso went out to look for ulysses,for she had heard jove's message. she found him sitting upon the beachwith his eyes ever filled with tears, and dying of sheerhome-sickness; for he had got tired of calypso, and though he wasforced to sleep with her in the cave by night, it was she, not he,that would have it so. as for the day time, he spent it on the rocksand on the sea-shore, weeping, crying aloud for his despair, andalways looking out upon the sea. calypso then went close up to himsaid:
"my poor fellow, you shall not stay here grieving and frettingyour life out any longer. i am going to send you away of my own freewill; so go, cut some beams of wood, and make yourself a large raftwith an upper deck that it may carry you safely over the sea. i willput bread, wine, and water on board to save you from starving. iwill also give you clothes, and will send you a fair wind to takeyou home, if the gods in heaven so will it- for they know more aboutthese things, and can settle them better than i can."
ulysses shuddered as he heard her. "now goddess," he answered,"there is something behind all this; you cannot be really meaning tohelp me home when you bid me do such a dreadful thing as put to sea ona raft. not even a well-found ship with a fair wind could venture onsuch a distant voyage: nothing that you can say or do shall mage me goon board a raft unless you first solemnly swear that you mean me nomischief."
calypso smiled at this and caressed him with her hand: "you know agreat deal," said she, "but you are quite wrong here. may heaven aboveand earth below be my witnesses, with the waters of the river styx-and this is the most solemn oath which a blessed god can take- thati mean you no sort of harm, and am only advising you to do exactlywhat i should do myself in your place. i am dealing with you quitestraightforwardly; my heart is not made of iron, and i am very sorryfor you."
when she had thus spoken she led the way rapidly before him, andulysses followed in her steps; so the pair, goddess and man, went onand on till they came to calypso's cave, where ulysses took the seatthat mercury had just left. calypso set meat and drink before him ofthe food that mortals eat; but her maids brought ambrosia and nectarfor herself, and they laid their hands on the good things that werebefore them. when they had satisfied themselves with meat and drink,calypso spoke, saying:
"ulysses, noble son of laertes, so you would start home to yourown land at once? good luck go with you, but if you could only knowhow much suffering is in store for you before you get back to your owncountry, you would stay where you are, keep house along with me, andlet me make you immortal, no matter how anxious you may be to see thiswife of yours, of whom you are thinking all the time day after day;yet i flatter myself that at am no whit less tall or well-looking thanshe is, for it is not to be expected that a mortal woman shouldcompare in beauty with an immortal."
"goddess," replied ulysses, "do not be angry with me about this. iam quite aware that my wife penelope is nothing like so tall or sobeautiful as yourself. she is only a woman, whereas you are animmortal. nevertheless, i want to get home, and can think of nothingelse. if some god wrecks me when i am on the sea, i will bear it andmake the best of it. i have had infinite trouble both by land andsea already, so let this go with the rest."
presently the sun set and it became dark, whereon the pair retiredinto the inner part of the cave and went to bed.
when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, ulysses puton his shirt and cloak, while the goddess wore a dress of a lightgossamer fabric, very fine and graceful, with a beautiful goldengirdle about her waist and a veil to cover her head. she at once setherself to think how she could speed ulysses on his way. so she gavehim a great bronze axe that suited his hands; it was sharpened on bothsides, and had a beautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on to it.she also gave him a sharp adze, and then led the way to the far end ofthe island where the largest trees grew- alder, poplar and pine,that reached the sky- very dry and well seasoned, so as to saillight for him in the water. then, when she had shown him where thebest trees grew, calypso went home, leaving him to cut them, whichhe soon finished doing. he cut down twenty trees in all and adzed themsmooth, squaring them by rule in good workmanlike fashion. meanwhilecalypso came back with some augers, so he bored holes with them andfitted the timbers together with bolts and rivets. he made the raft asbroad as a skilled shipwright makes the beam of a large vessel, and hefiled a deck on top of the ribs, and ran a gunwale all round it. healso made a mast with a yard arm, and a rudder to steer with. hefenced the raft all round with wicker hurdles as a protectionagainst the waves, and then he threw on a quantity of wood. by andby calypso brought him some linen to make the sails, and he made thesetoo, excellently, making them fast with braces and sheets. last ofall, with the help of levers, he drew the raft down into the water.
in four days he had completed the whole work, and on the fifthcalypso sent him from the island after washing him and giving him someclean clothes. she gave him a goat skin full of black wine, andanother larger one of water; she also gave him a wallet full ofprovisions, and found him in much good meat. moreover, she made thewind fair and warm for him, and gladly did ulysses spread his sailbefore it, while he sat and guided the raft skilfully by means ofthe rudder. he never closed his eyes, but kept them fixed on thepleiads, on late-setting bootes, and on the bear- which men alsocall the wain, and which turns round and round where it is, facingorion, and alone never dipping into the stream of oceanus- for calypsohad told him to keep this to his left. days seven and ten did hesail over the sea, and on the eighteenth the dim outlines of themountains on the nearest part of the phaeacian coast appeared,rising like a shield on the horizon.
but king neptune, who was returning from the ethiopians, caughtsight of ulysses a long way off, from the mountains of the solymi.he could see him sailing upon the sea, and it made him very angry,so he wagged his head and muttered to himself, saying, heavens, so thegods have been changing their minds about ulysses while i was awayin ethiopia, and now he is close to the land of the phaeacians,where it is decreed that he shall escape from the calamities that havebefallen him. still, he shall have plenty of hardship yet before hehas done with it."
thereon he gathered his clouds together, grasped his trident,stirred it round in the sea, and roused the rage of every wind thatblows till earth, sea, and sky were hidden in cloud, and nightsprang forth out of the heavens. winds from east, south, north, andwest fell upon him all at the same time, and a tremendous sea gotup, so that ulysses' heart began to fail him. "alas," he said tohimself in his dismay, "what ever will become of me? i am afraidcalypso was right when she said i should have trouble by sea beforei got back home. it is all coming true. how black is jove makingheaven with his clouds, and what a sea the winds are raising fromevery quarter at once. i am now safe to perish. blest and thrice blestwere those danaans who fell before troy in the cause of the sons ofatreus. would that had been killed on the day when the trojans werepressing me so sorely about the dead body of achilles, for then ishould have had due burial and the achaeans would have honoured myname; but now it seems that i shall come to a most pitiable end."
as he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrific fury that theraft reeled again, and he was carried overboard a long way off. he letgo the helm, and the force of the hurricane was so great that it brokethe mast half way up, and both sail and yard went over into the sea.for a long time ulysses was under water, and it was all he could do torise to the surface again, for the clothes calypso had given himweighed him down; but at last he got his head above water and spat outthe bitter brine that was running down his face in streams. in spiteof all this, however, he did not lose sight of his raft, but swam asfast as he could towards it, got hold of it, and climbed on boardagain so as to escape drowning. the sea took the raft and tossed itabout as autumn winds whirl thistledown round and round upon a road.it was as though the south, north, east, and west winds were allplaying battledore and shuttlecock with it at once.
when he was in this plight, ino daughter of cadmus, also calledleucothea, saw him. she had formerly been a mere mortal, but hadbeen since raised to the rank of a marine goddess. seeing in whatgreat distress ulysses now was, she had compassion upon him, and,rising like a sea-gull from the waves, took her seat upon the raft.
"my poor good man," said she, "why is neptune so furiously angrywith you? he is giving you a great deal of trouble, but for all hisbluster he will not kill you. you seem to be a sensible person, dothen as i bid you; strip, leave your raft to drive before the wind,and swim to the phaecian coast where better luck awaits you. and here,take my veil and put it round your chest; it is enchanted, and you cancome to no harm so long as you wear it. as soon as you touch land takeit off, throw it back as far as you can into the sea, and then go awayagain." with these words she took off her veil and gave it him. thenshe dived down again like a sea-gull and vanished beneath the darkblue waters.
but ulysses did not know what to think. "alas," he said to himselfin his dismay, "this is only some one or other of the gods who isluring me to ruin by advising me to will quit my raft. at any rate iwill not do so at present, for the land where she said i should bequit of all troubles seemed to be still a good way off. i know whati will do- i am sure it will be best- no matter what happens i willstick to the raft as long as her timbers hold together, but when thesea breaks her up i will swim for it; i do not see how i can do anybetter than this."
while he was thus in two minds, neptune sent a terrible great wavethat seemed to rear itself above his head till it broke right over theraft, which then went to pieces as though it were a heap of drychaff tossed about by a whirlwind. ulysses got astride of one plankand rode upon it as if he were on horseback; he then took off theclothes calypso had given him, bound ino's veil under his arms, andplunged into the sea- meaning to swim on shore. king neptune watchedhim as he did so, and wagged his head, muttering to himself andsaying, "'there now, swim up and down as you best can till you fall inwith well-to-do people. i do not think you will be able to say thati have let you off too lightly." on this he lashed his horses anddrove to aegae where his palace is.
but minerva resolved to help ulysses, so she bound the ways of allthe winds except one, and made them lie quite still; but she rouseda good stiff breeze from the north that should lay the waters tillulysses reached the land of the phaeacians where he would be safe.
thereon he floated about for two nights and two days in the water,with a heavy swell on the sea and death staring him in the face; butwhen the third day broke, the wind fell and there was a dead calmwithout so much as a breath of air stirring. as he rose on the swellhe looked eagerly ahead, and could see land quite near. then, aschildren rejoice when their dear father begins to get better afterhaving for a long time borne sore affliction sent him by some angryspirit, but the gods deliver him from evil, so was ulysses thankfulwhen he again saw land and trees, and swam on with all his strengththat he might once more set foot upon dry ground. when, however, hegot within earshot, he began to hear the surf thundering up againstthe rocks, for the swell still broke against them with a terrificroar. everything was enveloped in spray; there were no harbourswhere a ship might ride, nor shelter of any kind, but onlyheadlands, low-lying rocks, and mountain tops.
ulysses' heart now began to fail him, and he said despairingly tohimself, "alas, jove has let me see land after swimming so far thati had given up all hope, but i can find no landing place, for thecoast is rocky and surf-beaten, the rocks are smooth and rise sheerfrom the sea, with deep water close under them so that i cannotclimb out for want of foothold. i am afraid some great wave willlift me off my legs and dash me against the rocks as i leave thewater- which would give me a sorry landing. if, on the other hand, iswim further in search of some shelving beach or harbour, ahurricane may carry me out to sea again sorely against my will, orheaven may send some great monster of the deep to attack me; foramphitrite breeds many such, and i know that neptune is very angrywith me."
while he was thus in two minds a wave caught him and took him withsuch force against the rocks that he would have been smashed andtorn to pieces if minerva had not shown him what to do. he caught holdof the rock with both hands and clung to it groaning with pain tillthe wave retired, so he was saved that time; but presently the wavecame on again and carried him back with it far into the sea-tearinghis hands as the suckers of a polypus are torn when some one plucks itfrom its bed, and the stones come up along with it even so did therocks tear the skin from his strong hands, and then the wave drewhim deep down under the water.
here poor ulysses would have certainly perished even in spite of hisown destiny, if minerva had not helped him to keep his wits about him.he swam seaward again, beyond reach of the surf that was beatingagainst the land, and at the same time he kept looking towards theshore to see if he could find some haven, or a spit that should takethe waves aslant. by and by, as he swam on, he came to the mouth ofa river, and here he thought would be the best place, for there wereno rocks, and it afforded shelter from the wind. he felt that therewas a current, so he prayed inwardly and said:
"hear me, o king, whoever you may be, and save me from the angerof the sea-god neptune, for i approach you prayerfully. any one whohas lost his way has at all times a claim even upon the gods,wherefore in my distress i draw near to your stream, and cling tothe knees of your riverhood. have mercy upon me, o king, for i declaremyself your suppliant."
then the god stayed his stream and stilled the waves, making allcalm before him, and bringing him safely into the mouth of theriver. here at last ulysses' knees and strong hands failed him, forthe sea had completely broken him. his body was all swollen, and hismouth and nostrils ran down like a river with sea-water, so that hecould neither breathe nor speak, and lay swooning from sheerexhaustion; presently, when he had got his breath and came tohimself again, he took off the scarf that ino had given him andthrew it back into the salt stream of the river, whereon inoreceived it into her hands from the wave that bore it towards her.then he left the river, laid himself down among the rushes, and kissedthe bounteous earth.
"alas," he cried to himself in his dismay, "what ever will become ofme, and how is it all to end? if i stay here upon the river bedthrough the long watches of the night, i am so exhausted that thebitter cold and damp may make an end of me- for towards sunrisethere will be a keen wind blowing from off the river. if, on the otherhand, i climb the hill side, find shelter in the woods, and sleep insome thicket, i may escape the cold and have a good night's rest,but some savage beast may take advantage of me and devour me."
in the end he deemed it best to take to the woods, and he foundone upon some high ground not far from the water. there he creptbeneath two shoots of olive that grew from a single stock- the onean ungrafted sucker, while the other had been grafted. no wind,however squally, could break through the cover they afforded, norcould the sun's rays pierce them, nor the rain get through them, soclosely did they grow into one another. ulysses crept under theseand began to make himself a bed to lie on, for there was a greatlitter of dead leaves lying about- enough to make a covering for twoor three men even in hard winter weather. he was glad enough to seethis, so he laid himself down and heaped the leaves all round him.then, as one who lives alone in the country, far from any neighbor,hides a brand as fire-seed in the ashes to save himself from having toget a light elsewhere, even so did ulysses cover himself up withleaves; and minerva shed a sweet sleep upon his eyes, closed hiseyelids, and made him lose all memories of his sorrows.

so here ulysses slept, overcome by sleep and toil; but minervawent off to the country and city of the phaecians- a people who usedto live in the fair town of hypereia, near the lawless cyclopes. nowthe cyclopes were stronger than they and plundered them, so their kingnausithous moved them thence and settled them in scheria, far from allother people. he surrounded the city with a wall, built houses andtemples, and divided the lands among his people; but he was dead andgone to the house of hades, and king alcinous, whose counsels wereinspired of heaven, was now reigning. to his house, then, didminerva hie in furtherance of the return of ulysses.
she went straight to the beautifully decorated bedroom in whichthere slept a girl who was as lovely as a goddess, nausicaa,daughter to king alcinous. two maid servants were sleeping near her,both very pretty, one on either side of the doorway, which wasclosed with well-made folding doors. minerva took the form of thefamous sea captain dymas's daughter, who was a bosom friend ofnausicaa and just her own age; then, coming up to the girl's bedsidelike a breath of wind, she hovered over her head and said:
"nausicaa, what can your mother have been about, to have such a lazydaughter? here are your clothes all lying in disorder, yet you aregoing to be married almost immediately, and should not only be welldressed yourself, but should find good clothes for those who attendyou. this is the way to get yourself a good name, and to make yourfather and mother proud of you. suppose, then, that we make tomorrow awashing day, and start at daybreak. i will come and help you so thatyou may have everything ready as soon as possible, for all the bestyoung men among your own people are courting you, and you are notgoing to remain a maid much longer. ask your father, therefore, tohave a waggon and mules ready for us at daybreak, to take the rugs,robes, and girdles; and you can ride, too, which will be muchpleasanter for you than walking, for the washing-cisterns are some wayfrom the town."
when she had said this minerva went away to olympus, which theysay is the everlasting home of the gods. here no wind beats roughly,and neither rain nor snow can fall; but it abides in everlastingsunshine and in a great peacefulness of light, wherein the blessedgods are illumined for ever and ever. this was the place to whichthe goddess went when she had given instructions to the girl.
by and by morning came and woke nausicaa, who began wonderingabout her dream; she therefore went to the other end of the house totell her father and mother all about it, and found them in their ownroom. her mother was sitting by the fireside spinning her purpleyarn with her maids around her, and she happened to catch her fatherjust as he was going out to attend a meeting of the town council,which the phaeacian aldermen had convened. she stopped him and said:
"papa dear, could you manage to let me have a good big waggon? iwant to take all our dirty clothes to the river and wash them. you arethe chief man here, so it is only right that you should have a cleanshirt when you attend meetings of the council. moreover, you have fivesons at home, two of them married, while the other three aregood-looking bachelors; you know they always like to have cleanlinen when they go to a dance, and i have been thinking about allthis."
she did not say a word about her own wedding, for she did not liketo, but her father knew and said, "you shall have the mules, mylove, and whatever else you have a mind for. be off with you, andthe men shall get you a good strong waggon with a body to it that willhold all your clothes."
on this he gave his orders to the servants, who got the waggonout, harnessed the mules, and put them to, while the girl broughtthe clothes down from the linen room and placed them on the waggon.her mother prepared her a basket of provisions with all sorts ofgood things, and a goat skin full of wine; the girl now got into thewaggon, and her mother gave her also a golden cruse of oil, that sheand her women might anoint themselves. then she took the whip andreins and lashed the mules on, whereon they set off, and their hoofsclattered on the road. they pulled without flagging, and carried notonly nausicaa and her wash of clothes, but the maids also who werewith her.
when they reached the water side they went to thewashing-cisterns, through which there ran at all times enough purewater to wash any quantity of linen, no matter how dirty. here theyunharnessed the mules and turned them out to feed on the sweet juicyherbage that grew by the water side. they took the clothes out ofthe waggon, put them in the water, and vied with one another intreading them in the pits to get the dirt out. after they had washedthem and got them quite clean, they laid them out by the sea side,where the waves had raised a high beach of shingle, and set aboutwashing themselves and anointing themselves with olive oil. thenthey got their dinner by the side of the stream, and waited for thesun to finish drying the clothes. when they had done dinner they threwoff the veils that covered their heads and began to play at ball,while nausicaa sang for them. as the huntress diana goes forth uponthe mountains of taygetus or erymanthus to hunt wild boars or deer,and the wood-nymphs, daughters of aegis-bearing jove, take their sportalong with her (then is leto proud at seeing her daughter stand a fullhead taller than the others, and eclipse the loveliest amid a wholebevy of beauties), even so did the girl outshine her handmaids.
when it was time for them to start home, and they were folding theclothes and putting them into the waggon, minerva began to considerhow ulysses should wake up and see the handsome girl who was toconduct him to the city of the phaeacians. the girl, therefore,threw a ball at one of the maids, which missed her and fell intodeep water. on this they all shouted, and the noise they made wokeulysses, who sat up in his bed of leaves and began to wonder what itmight all be.
"alas," said he to himself, "what kind of people have i comeamongst? are they cruel, savage, and uncivilized, or hospitable andhumane? i seem to hear the voices of young women, and they soundlike those of the nymphs that haunt mountain tops, or springs ofrivers and meadows of green grass. at any rate i am among a race ofmen and women. let me try if i cannot manage to get a look at them."
as he said this he crept from under his bush, and broke off abough covered with thick leaves to hide his nakedness. he lookedlike some lion of the wilderness that stalks about exulting in hisstrength and defying both wind and rain; his eyes glare as he prowlsin quest of oxen, sheep, or deer, for he is famished, and will darebreak even into a well-fenced homestead, trying to get at the sheep-even such did ulysses seem to the young women, as he drew near to themall naked as he was, for he was in great want. on seeing one sounkempt and so begrimed with salt water, the others scampered offalong the spits that jutted out into the sea, but the daughter ofalcinous stood firm, for minerva put courage into her heart and tookaway all fear from her. she stood right in front of ulysses, and hedoubted whether he should go up to her, throw himself at her feet, andembrace her knees as a suppliant, or stay where he was and entreat herto give him some clothes and show him the way to the town. in theend he deemed it best to entreat her from a distance in case thegirl should take offence at his coming near enough to clasp her knees,so he addressed her in honeyed and persuasive language.
"o queen," he said, "i implore your aid- but tell me, are you agoddess or are you a mortal woman? if you are a goddess and dwell inheaven, i can only conjecture that you are jove's daughter diana,for your face and figure resemble none but hers; if on the otherhand you are a mortal and live on earth, thrice happy are yourfather and mother- thrice happy, too, are your brothers and sisters;how proud and delighted they must feel when they see so fair a scionas yourself going out to a dance; most happy, however, of all willhe be whose wedding gifts have been the richest, and who takes youto his own home. i never yet saw any one so beautiful, neither man norwoman, and am lost in admiration as i behold you. i can only compareyou to a young palm tree which i saw when i was at delos growingnear the altar of apollo- for i was there, too, with much people afterme, when i was on that journey which has been the source of all mytroubles. never yet did such a young plant shoot out of the groundas that was, and i admired and wondered at it exactly as i nowadmire and wonder at yourself. i dare not clasp your knees, but i amin great distress; yesterday made the twentieth day that i had beentossing about upon the sea. the winds and waves have taken me allthe way from the ogygian island, and now fate has flung me upon thiscoast that i may endure still further suffering; for i do not thinkthat i have yet come to the end of it, but rather that heaven hasstill much evil in store for me.
"and now, o queen, have pity upon me, for you are the first person ihave met, and i know no one else in this country. show me the way toyour town, and let me have anything that you may have brought hitherto wrap your clothes in. may heaven grant you in all things yourheart's desire- husband, house, and a happy, peaceful home; forthere is nothing better in this world than that man and wife should beof one mind in a house. it discomfits their enemies, makes thehearts of their friends glad, and they themselves know more about itthan any one."
to this nausicaa answered, "stranger, you appear to be a sensible,well-disposed person. there is no accounting for luck; jove givesprosperity to rich and poor just as he chooses, so you must takewhat he has seen fit to send you, and make the best of it. now,however, that you have come to this our country, you shall not wantfor clothes nor for anything else that a foreigner in distress mayreasonably look for. i will show you the way to the town, and willtell you the name of our people; we are called phaeacians, and i amdaughter to alcinous, in whom the whole power of the state is vested."
then she called her maids and said, "stay where you are, yougirls. can you not see a man without running away from him? do youtake him for a robber or a murderer? neither he nor any one else cancome here to do us phaeacians any harm, for we are dear to the gods,and live apart on a land's end that juts into the sounding sea, andhave nothing to do with any other people. this is only some poor manwho has lost his way, and we must be kind to him, for strangers andforeigners in distress are under jove's protection, and will take whatthey can get and be thankful; so, girls, give the poor fellowsomething to eat and drink, and wash him in the stream at some placethat is sheltered from the wind."
on this the maids left off running away and began calling oneanother back. they made ulysses sit down in the shelter as nausicaahad told them, and brought him a shirt and cloak. they also broughthim the little golden cruse of oil, and told him to go wash in thestream. but ulysses said, "young women, please to stand a little onone side that i may wash the brine from my shoulders and anoint myselfwith oil, for it is long enough since my skin has had a drop of oilupon it. i cannot wash as long as you all keep standing there. i amashamed to strip before a number of good-looking young women."
then they stood on one side and went to tell the girl, while ulysseswashed himself in the stream and scrubbed the brine from his backand from his broad shoulders. when he had thoroughly washed himself,and had got the brine out of his hair, he anointed himself with oil,and put on the clothes which the girl had given him; minerva then madehim look taller and stronger than before, she also made the hairgrow thick on the top of his head, and flow down in curls likehyacinth blossoms; she glorified him about the head and shoulders as askilful workman who has studied art of all kinds under vulcan andminerva enriches a piece of silver plate by gilding it- and his workis full of beauty. then he went and sat down a little way off upon thebeach, looking quite young and handsome, and the girl gazed on himwith admiration; then she said to her maids:
"hush, my dears, for i want to say something. i believe the gods wholive in heaven have sent this man to the phaeacians. when i firstsaw him i thought him plain, but now his appearance is like that ofthe gods who dwell in heaven. i should like my future husband to bejust such another as he is, if he would only stay here and not want togo away. however, give him something to eat and drink."
they did as they were told, and set food before ulysses, who ate anddrank ravenously, for it was long since he had had food of any kind.meanwhile, nausicaa bethought her of another matter. she got the linenfolded and placed in the waggon, she then yoked the mules, and, as shetook her seat, she called ulysses:
"stranger," said she, "rise and let us be going back to the town;i will introduce you at the house of my excellent father, where ican tell you that you will meet all the best people among thephaecians. but be sure and do as i bid you, for you seem to be asensible person. as long as we are going past the fields- and farmlands, follow briskly behind the waggon along with the maids and iwill lead the way myself. presently, however, we shall come to thetown, where you will find a high wall running all round it, and a goodharbour on either side with a narrow entrance into the city, and theships will be drawn up by the road side, for every one has a placewhere his own ship can lie. you will see the market place with atemple of neptune in the middle of it, and paved with large stonesbedded in the earth. here people deal in ship's gear of all kinds,such as cables and sails, and here, too, are the places where oars aremade, for the phaeacians are not a nation of archers; they knownothing about bows and arrows, but are a sea-faring folk, and pridethemselves on their masts, oars, and ships, with which they travel farover the sea.
"i am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on footagainst me later on; for the people here are very ill-natured, andsome low fellow, if he met us, might say, 'who is this fine-lookingstranger that is going about with nausicaa? where did she end him? isuppose she is going to marry him. perhaps he is a vagabond sailorwhom she has taken from some foreign vessel, for we have noneighbours; or some god has at last come down from heaven in answer toher prayers, and she is going to live with him all the rest of herlife. it would be a good thing if she would take herself of i for shand find a husband somewhere else, for she will not look at one of themany excellent young phaeacians who are in with her.' this is the kindof disparaging remark that would be made about me, and i could notcomplain, for i should myself be scandalized at seeing any othergirl do the like, and go about with men in spite of everybody, whileher father and mother were still alive, and without having beenmarried in the face of all the world.
"if, therefore, you want my father to give you an escort and to helpyou home, do as i bid you; you will see a beautiful grove of poplarsby the road side dedicated to minerva; it has a well in it and ameadow all round it. here my father has a field of rich garden ground,about as far from the town as a man' voice will carry. sit downthere and wait for a while till the rest of us can get into the townand reach my father's house. then, when you think we must have donethis, come into the town and ask the way to the house of my fatheralcinous. you will have no difficulty in finding it; any child willpoint it out to you, for no one else in the whole town has anythinglike such a fine house as he has. when you have got past the gates andthrough the outer court, go right across the inner court till you cometo my mother. you will find her sitting by the fire and spinning herpurple wool by firelight. it is a fine sight to see her as she leansback against one of the bearing-posts with her maids all ranged behindher. close to her seat stands that of my father, on which he sitsand topes like an immortal god. never mind him, but go up to mymother, and lay your hands upon her knees if you would get homequickly. if you can gain her over, you may hope to see your owncountry again, no matter how distant it may be."
so saying she lashed the mules with her whip and they left theriver. the mules drew well and their hoofs went up and down upon theroad. she was careful not to go too fast for ulysses and the maids whowere following on foot along with the waggon, so she plied her whipwith judgement. as the sun was going down they came to the sacredgrove of minerva, and there ulysses sat down and prayed to themighty daughter of jove.
"hear me," he cried, "daughter of aegis-bearing jove, unweariable,hear me now, for you gave no heed to my prayers when neptune waswrecking me. now, therefore, have pity upon me and grant that i mayfind friends and be hospitably received by the phaecians."
thus did he pray, and minerva heard his prayer, but she would notshow herself to him openly, for she was afraid of her uncle neptune,who was still furious in his endeavors to prevent ulysses from gettinghome.
book vii.
thus, then, did ulysses wait and pray; but the girl drove on tothe town. when she reached her father's house she drew up at thegateway, and her brothers- comely as the gods- gathered round her,took the mules out of the waggon, and carried the clothes into thehouse, while she went to her own room, where an old servant,eurymedusa of apeira, lit the fire for her. this old woman had beenbrought by sea from apeira, and had been chosen as a prize foralcinous because he was king over the phaecians, and the people obeyedhim as though he were a god. she had been nurse to nausicaa, and hadnow lit the fire for her, and brought her supper for her into herown room.
presently ulysses got up to go towards the town; and minerva sheda thick mist all round him to hide him in case any of the proudphaecians who met him should be rude to him, or ask him who he was.then, as he was just entering the town, she came towards him in thelikeness of a little girl carrying a pitcher. she stood right in frontof him, and ulysses said:
"my dear, will you be so kind as to show me the house of kingalcinous? i am an unfortunate foreigner in distress, and do not knowone in your town and country."
then minerva said, "yes, father stranger, i will show you thehouse you want, for alcinous lives quite close to my own father. iwill go before you and show the way, but say not a word as you go, anddo not look at any man, nor ask him questions; for the people herecannot abide strangers, and do not like men who come from some otherplace. they are a sea-faring folk, and sail the seas by the grace ofneptune in ships that glide along like thought, or as a bird in theair."
on this she led the way, and ulysses followed in her steps; butnot one of the phaecians could see him as he passed through the cityin the midst of them; for the great goddess minerva in her good willtowards him had hidden him in a thick cloud of darkness. he admiredtheir harbours, ships, places of assembly, and the lofty walls ofthe city, which, with the palisade on top of them, were very striking,and when they reached the king's house minerva said:
"this is the house, father stranger, which you would have me showyou. you will find a number of great people sitting at table, but donot be afraid; go straight in, for the bolder a man is the more likelyhe is to carry his point, even though he is a stranger. first find thequeen. her name is arete, and she comes of the same family as herhusband alcinous. they both descend originally from neptune, who wasfather to nausithous by periboea, a woman of great beauty. periboeawas the youngest daughter of eurymedon, who at one time reigned overthe giants, but he ruined his ill-fated people and lost his own lifeto boot.
"neptune, however, lay with his daughter, and she had a son byhim, the great nausithous, who reigned over the phaecians.nausithous had two sons rhexenor and alcinous; apollo killed the firstof them while he was still a bridegroom and without male issue; but heleft a daughter arete, whom alcinous married, and honours as noother woman is honoured of all those that keep house along withtheir husbands.
"thus she both was, and still is, respected beyond measure by herchildren, by alcinous himself, and by the whole people, who lookupon her as a goddess, and greet her whenever she goes about the city,for she is a thoroughly good woman both in head and heart, and whenany women are friends of hers, she will help their husbands also tosettle their disputes. if you can gain her good will, you may haveevery hope of seeing your friends again, and getting safely back toyour home and country."
then minerva left scheria and went away over the sea. she went tomarathon and to the spacious streets of athens, where she enteredthe abode of erechtheus; but ulysses went on to the house of alcinous,and he pondered much as he paused a while before reaching thethreshold of bronze, for the splendour of the palace was like thatof the sun or moon. the walls on either side were of bronze from endto end, and the cornice was of blue enamel. the doors were gold, andhung on pillars of silver that rose from a floor of bronze, whilethe lintel was silver and the hook of the door was of gold.
on either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which vulcan,with his consummate skill, had fashioned expressly to keep watchover the palace of king alcinous; so they were immortal and couldnever grow old. seats were ranged all along the wall, here and therefrom one end to the other, with coverings of fine woven work which thewomen of the house had made. here the chief persons of the phaeciansused to sit and eat and drink, for there was abundance at all seasons;and there were golden figures of young men with lighted torches intheir hands, raised on pedestals, to give light by night to thosewho were at table. there are fifty maid servants in the house, some ofwhom are always grinding rich yellow grain at the mill, while otherswork at the loom, or sit and spin, and their shuttles go, backwardsand forwards like the fluttering of aspen leaves, while the linen isso closely woven that it will turn oil. as the phaecians are thebest sailors in the world, so their women excel all others in weaving,for minerva has taught them all manner of useful arts, and they arevery intelligent.
outside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of aboutfour acres with a wall all round it. it is full of beautiful trees-pears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. there are lusciousfigs also, and olives in full growth. the fruits never rot nor failall the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is sosoft that a new crop ripens before the old has dropped. pear growson pear, apple on apple, and fig on fig, and so also with thegrapes, for there is an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of apart of this, the grapes are being made into raisins; in anotherpart they are being gathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs,others further on have shed their blossom and are beginning to showfruit, others again are just changing colour. in the furthest partof the ground there are beautifully arranged beds of flowers thatare in bloom all the year round. two streams go through it, the oneturned in ducts throughout the whole garden, while the other iscarried under the ground of the outer court to the house itself, andthe town's people draw water from it. such, then, were thesplendours with which the gods had endowed the house of king alcinous.
so here ulysses stood for a while and looked about him, but whenhe had looked long enough he crossed the threshold and went within theprecincts of the house. there he found all the chief people amongthe phaecians making their drink-offerings to mercury, which theyalways did the last thing before going away for the night. he wentstraight through the court, still hidden by the cloak of darkness inwhich minerva had enveloped him, till he reached arete and kingalcinous; then he laid his hands upon the knees of the queen, and atthat moment the miraculous darkness fell away from him and he becamevisible. every one was speechless with surprise at seeing a man there,but ulysses began at once with his petition.
"queen arete," he exclaimed, "daughter of great rhexenor, in mydistress i humbly pray you, as also your husband and these your guests(whom may heaven prosper with long life and happiness, and may theyleave their possessions to their children, and all the honoursconferred upon them by the state) to help me home to my own country assoon as possible; for i have been long in trouble and away from myfriends."
then he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all heldtheir peace, till presently the old hero echeneus, who was anexcellent speaker and an elder among the phaeacians, plainly and inall honesty addressed them thus:
"alcinous," said he, "it is not creditable to you that a strangershould be seen sitting among the ashes of your hearth; every one iswaiting to hear what you are about to say; tell him, then, to rise andtake a seat on a stool inlaid with silver, and bid your servants mixsome wine and water that we may make a drink-offering to jove the lordof thunder, who takes all well-disposed suppliants under hisprotection; and let the housekeeper give him some supper, ofwhatever there may be in the house."
when alcinous heard this he took ulysses by the hand, raised himfrom the hearth, and bade him take the seat of laodamas, who hadbeen sitting beside him, and was his favourite son. a maid servantthen brought him water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into asilver basin for him to wash his hands, and she drew a clean tablebeside him; an upper servant brought him bread and offered him manygood things of what there was in the house, and ulysses ate and drank.then alcinous said to one of the servants, "pontonous, mix a cup ofwine and hand it round that we may make drink-offerings to jove thelord of thunder, who is the protector of all well-disposedsuppliants."
pontonous then mixed wine and water, and handed it round aftergiving every man his drink-offering. when they had made theirofferings, and had drunk each as much as he was minded, alcinous said:
"aldermen and town councillors of the phaeacians, hear my words. youhave had your supper, so now go home to bed. to-morrow morning i shallinvite a still larger number of aldermen, and will give asacrificial banquet in honour of our guest; we can then discuss thequestion of his escort, and consider how we may at once send himback rejoicing to his own country without trouble or inconvenienceto himself, no matter how distant it may be. we must see that he comesto no harm while on his homeward journey, but when he is once athome he will have to take the luck he was born with for better orworse like other people. it is possible, however, that the stranger isone of the immortals who has come down from heaven to visit us; but inthis case the gods are departing from their usual practice, forhitherto they have made themselves perfectly clear to us when wehave been offering them hecatombs. they come and sit at our feastsjust like one of our selves, and if any solitary wayfarer happens tostumble upon some one or other of them, they affect no concealment,for we are as near of kin to the gods as the cyclopes and the savagegiants are."
then ulysses said: "pray, alcinous, do not take any such notion intoyour head. i have nothing of the immortal about me, neither in bodynor mind, and most resemble those among you who are the mostafflicted. indeed, were i to tell you all that heaven has seen fitto lay upon me, you would say that i was still worse off than theyare. nevertheless, let me sup in spite of sorrow, for an empty stomachis a very importunate thing, and thrusts itself on a man's notice nomatter how dire is his distress. i am in great trouble, yet it insiststhat i shall eat and drink, bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrowsand dwell only on the due replenishing of itself. as for yourselves,do as you propose, and at break of day set about helping me to gethome. i shall be content to die if i may first once more behold myproperty, my bondsmen, and all the greatness of my house."
thus did he speak. every one approved his saying, and agreed that heshould have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. then whenthey had made their drink-offerings, and had drunk each as much ashe was minded they went home to bed every man in his own abode,leaving ulysses in the cloister with arete and alcinous while theservants were taking the things away after supper. arete was the firstto speak, for she recognized the shirt, cloak, and good clothes thatulysses was wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; so shesaid, "stranger, before we go any further, there is a question ishould like to ask you. who, and whence are you, and who gave youthose clothes? did you not say you had come here from beyond the sea?"
and ulysses answered, "it would be a long story madam, were i torelate in full the tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heavenhas been laid heavy upon me; but as regards your question, there is anisland far away in the sea which is called 'the ogygian.' heredwells the cunning and powerful goddess calypso, daughter of atlas.she lives by herself far from all neighbours human or divine. fortune,however, me to her hearth all desolate and alone, for jove struck myship with his thunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. my bravecomrades were drowned every man of them, but i stuck to the keel andwas carried hither and thither for the space of nine days, till atlast during the darkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to theogygian island where the great goddess calypso lives. she took me inand treated me with the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted to makeme immortal that i might never grow old, but she could not persuade meto let her do so.
"i stayed with calypso seven years straight on end, and wateredthe good clothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time;but at last when the eighth year came round she bade me depart ofher own free will, either because jove had told her she must, orbecause she had changed her mind. she sent me from her island on araft, which she provisioned with abundance of bread and wine. moreovershe gave me good stout clothing, and sent me a wind that blew bothwarm and fair. days seven and ten did i sail over the sea, and onthe eighteenth i caught sight of the first outlines of the mountainsupon your coast- and glad indeed was i to set eyes upon them.nevertheless there was still much trouble in store for me, for at thispoint neptune would let me go no further, and raised a great stormagainst me; the sea was so terribly high that i could no longer keepto my raft, which went to pieces under the fury of the gale, and i hadto swim for it, till wind and current brought me to your shores.
"there i tried to land, but could not, for it was a bad place andthe waves dashed me against the rocks, so i again took to the seaand swam on till i came to a river that seemed the most likely landingplace, for there were no rocks and it was sheltered from the wind.here, then, i got out of the water and gathered my senses togetheragain. night was coming on, so i left the river, and went into athicket, where i covered myself all over with leaves, and presentlyheaven sent me off into a very deep sleep. sick and sorry as i was islept among the leaves all night, and through the next day tillafternoon, when i woke as the sun was westering, and saw yourdaughter's maid servants playing upon the beach, and your daughteramong them looking like a goddess. i besought her aid, and sheproved to be of an excellent disposition, much more so than could beexpected from so young a person- for young people are apt to bethoughtless. she gave me plenty of bread and wine, and when she hadhad me washed in the river she also gave me the clothes in which yousee me. now, therefore, though it has pained me to do so, i havetold you the whole truth."
then alcinous said, "stranger, it was very wrong of my daughternot to bring you on at once to my house along with the maids, seeingthat she was the first person whose aid you asked."
"pray do not scold her," replied ulysses; "she is not to blame.she did tell me to follow along with the maids, but i was ashamedand afraid, for i thought you might perhaps be displeased if you sawme. every human being is sometimes a little suspicious and irritable."
"stranger," replied alcinous, "i am not the kind of man to get angryabout nothing; it is always better to be reasonable; but by fatherjove, minerva, and apollo, now that i see what kind of person you are,and how much you think as i do, i wish you would stay here, marry mydaughter, and become my son-in-law. if you will stay i will give you ahouse and an estate, but no one (heaven forbid) shall keep you hereagainst your own wish, and that you may be sure of this i willattend to-morrow to the matter of your escort. you can sleep duringthe whole voyage if you like, and the men shall sail you over smoothwaters either to your own home, or wherever you please, even though itbe a long way further off than euboea, which those of my people whosaw it when they took yellow-haired rhadamanthus to see tityus the sonof gaia, tell me is the furthest of any place- and yet they did thewhole voyage in a single day without distressing themselves, andcame back again afterwards. you will thus see how much my shipsexcel all others, and what magnificent oarsmen my sailors are."
then was ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, "father jove, grantthat alcinous may do all as he has said, for so he will win animperishable name among mankind, and at the same time i shall returnto my country."
thus did they converse. then arete told her maids to set a bed inthe room that was in the gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs,and to spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks forulysses to wear. the maids thereon went out with torches in theirhands, and when they had made the bed they came up to ulysses andsaid, "rise, sir stranger, and come with us for your bed is ready,"and glad indeed was he to go to his rest.
so ulysses slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway;but alcinous lay in the inner part of the house, with the queen hiswife by his side.
book viii.
now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared,alcinous and ulysses both rose, and alcinous led the way to thephaecian place of assembly, which was near the ships. when they gotthere they sat down side by side on a seat of polished stone, whileminerva took the form of one of alcinous' servants, and went round thetown in order to help ulysses to get home. she went up to thecitizens, man by man, and said, "aldermen and town councillors ofthe phaeacians, come to the assembly all of you and listen to thestranger who has just come off a long voyage to the house of kingalcinous; he looks like an immortal god."
with these words she made them all want to come, and they flocked tothe assembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded. everyone was struck with the appearance of ulysses, for minerva hadbeautified him about the head and shoulders, making him look tallerand stouter than he really was, that he might impress the phaeciansfavourably as being a very remarkable man, and might come off wellin the many trials of skill to which they would challenge him. then,when they were got together, alcinous spoke:
"hear me," said he, "aldermen and town councillors of thephaeacians, that i may speak even as i am minded. this stranger,whoever he may be, has found his way to my house from somewhere orother either east or west. he wants an escort and wishes to have thematter settled. let us then get one ready for him, as we have done forothers before him; indeed, no one who ever yet came to my house hasbeen able to complain of me for not speeding on his way soon enough.let us draw a ship into the sea- one that has never yet made a voyage-and man her with two and fifty of our smartest young sailors. thenwhen you have made fast your oars each by his own seat, leave the shipand come to my house to prepare a feast. i will find you ineverything. i am giving will these instructions to the young men whowill form the crew, for as regards you aldermen and towncouncillors, you will join me in entertaining our guest in thecloisters. i can take no excuses, and we will have demodocus to singto us; for there is no bard like him whatever he may choose to singabout."
alcinous then led the way, and the others followed after, while aservant went to fetch demodocus. the fifty-two picked oarsmen wentto the sea shore as they had been told, and when they got there theydrew the ship into the water, got her mast and sails inside her, boundthe oars to the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all indue course, and spread the white sails aloft. they moored the vessel alittle way out from land, and then came on shore and went to the houseof king alcinous. the outhouses, yards, and all the precincts werefilled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young;and alcinous killed them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and twooxen. these they skinned and dressed so as to provide a magnificentbanquet.
a servant presently led in the famous bard demodocus, whom themuse had dearly loved, but to whom she had given both good and evil,for though she had endowed him with a divine gift of song, she hadrobbed him of his eyesight. pontonous set a seat for him among theguests, leaning it up against a bearing-post. he hung the lyre for himon a peg over his head, and showed him where he was to feel for itwith his hands. he also set a fair table with a basket of victualsby his side, and a cup of wine from which he might drink whenever hewas so disposed.
the company then laid their hands upon the good things that werebefore them, but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,the muse inspired demodocus to sing the feats of heroes, and moreespecially a matter that was then in the mouths of all men, to wit,the quarrel between ulysses and achilles, and the fierce words thatthey heaped on one another as they gat together at a banquet. butagamemnon was glad when he heard his chieftains quarrelling with oneanother, for apollo had foretold him this at pytho when he crossed thestone floor to consult the oracle. here was the beginning of theevil that by the will of jove fell both danaans and trojans.
thus sang the bard, but ulysses drew his purple mantle over his headand covered his face, for he was ashamed to let the phaeacians seethat he was weeping. when the bard left off singing he wiped the tearsfrom his eyes, uncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made adrink-offering to the gods; but when the phaeacians presseddemodocus to sing further, for they delighted in his lays, thenulysses again drew his mantle over his head and wept bitterly. noone noticed his distress except alcinous, who was sitting near him,and heard the heavy sighs that he was heaving. so he at once said,"aldermen and town councillors of the phaeacians, we have had enoughnow, both of the feast, and of the minstrelsy that is its dueaccompaniment; let us proceed therefore to the athletic sports, sothat our guest on his return home may be able to tell his friendshow much we surpass all other nations as boxers, wrestlers, jumpers,and runners."
with these words he led the way, and the others followed after. aservant hung demodocus's lyre on its peg for him, led him out of thecloister, and set him on the same way as that along which all thechief men of the phaeacians were going to see the sports; a crowd ofseveral thousands of people followed them, and there were manyexcellent competitors for all the prizes. acroneos, ocyalus, elatreus,nauteus, prymneus, anchialus, eretmeus, ponteus, proreus, thoon,anabesineus, and amphialus son of polyneus son of tecton. there wasalso euryalus son of naubolus, who was like mars himself, and wasthe best looking man among the phaecians except laodamas. three sonsof alcinous, laodamas, halios, and clytoneus, competed also.
the foot races came first. the course was set out for them fromthe starting post, and they raised a dust upon the plain as they allflew forward at the same moment. clytoneus came in first by a longway; he left every one else behind him by the length of the furrowthat a couple of mules can plough in a fallow field. they thenturned to the painful art of wrestling, and here euryalus proved to bethe best man. amphialus excelled all the others in jumping, while atthrowing the disc there was no one who could approach elatreus.alcinous's son laodamas was the best boxer, and he it was whopresently said, when they had all been diverted with the games, "letus ask the stranger whether he excels in any of these sports; he seemsvery powerfully built; his thighs, claves, hands, and neck are ofprodigious strength, nor is he at all old, but he has suffered muchlately, and there is nothing like the sea for making havoc with a man,no matter how strong he is."
"you are quite right, laodamas," replied euryalus, "go up to yourguest and speak to him about it yourself."
when laodamas heard this he made his way into the middle of thecrowd and said to ulysses, "i hope, sir, that you will enteryourself for some one or other of our competitions if you areskilled in any of them- and you must have gone in for many a onebefore now. there is nothing that does any one so much credit allhis life long as the showing himself a proper man with his hands andfeet. have a try therefore at something, and banish all sorrow fromyour mind. your return home will not be long delayed, for the shipis already drawn into the water, and the crew is found."
ulysses answered, "laodamas, why do you taunt me in this way? mymind is set rather on cares than contests; i have been throughinfinite trouble, and am come among you now as a suppliant, prayingyour king and people to further me on my return home."
then euryalus reviled him outright and said, "i gather, then, thatyou are unskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delightin. i suppose you are one of those grasping traders that go about inships as captains or merchants, and who think of nothing but oftheir outward freights and homeward cargoes. there does not seem to bemuch of the athlete about you."
"for shame, sir," answered ulysses, fiercely, "you are an insolentfellow- so true is it that the gods do not grace all men alike inspeech, person, and understanding. one man may be of weak presence,but heaven has adorned this with such a good conversation that hecharms every one who sees him; his honeyed moderation carries hishearers with him so that he is leader in all assemblies of hisfellows, and wherever he goes he is looked up to. another may be ashandsome as a god, but his good looks are not crowned with discretion.this is your case. no god could make a finer looking fellow than youare, but you are a fool. your ill-judged remarks have made meexceedingly angry, and you are quite mistaken, for i excel in agreat many athletic exercises; indeed, so long as i had youth andstrength, i was among the first athletes of the age. now, however, iam worn out by labour and sorrow, for i have gone through much both onthe field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea; still, in spiteof all this i will compete, for your taunts have stung me to thequick."
so he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized adisc, larger, more massive and much heavier than those used by thephaeacians when disc-throwing among themselves. then, swinging itback, he threw it from his brawny hand, and it made a humming sound inthe air as he did so. the phaeacians quailed beneath the rushing ofits flight as it sped gracefully from his hand, and flew beyond anymark that had been made yet. minerva, in the form of a man, came andmarked the place where it had fallen. "a blind man, sir," said she,"could easily tell your mark by groping for it- it is so far aheadof any other. you may make your mind easy about this contest, for nophaeacian can come near to such a throw as yours."
ulysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers-on,so he began to speak more pleasantly. "young men," said he, "come upto that throw if you can, and i will throw another disc as heavy oreven heavier. if anyone wants to have a bout with me let him comeon, for i am exceedingly angry; i will box, wrestle, or run, i donot care what it is, with any man of you all except laodamas, butnot with him because i am his guest, and one cannot compete with one'sown personal friend. at least i do not think it a prudent or asensible thing for a guest to challenge his host's family at any game,especially when he is in a foreign country. he will cut the groundfrom under his own feet if he does; but i make no exception as regardsany one else, for i want to have the matter out and know which isthe best man. i am a good hand at every kind of athletic sport knownamong mankind. i am an excellent archer. in battle i am always thefirst to bring a man down with my arrow, no matter how many more aretaking aim at him alongside of me. philoctetes was the only man whocould shoot better than i could when we achaeans were before troyand in practice. i far excel every one else in the whole world, ofthose who still eat bread upon the face of the earth, but i should notlike to shoot against the mighty dead, such as hercules, or eurytusthe cechalian-men who could shoot against the gods themselves. this infact was how eurytus came prematurely by his end, for apollo was angrywith him and killed him because he challenged him as an archer. ican throw a dart farther than any one else can shoot an arrow. runningis the only point in respect of which i am afraid some of thephaecians might beat me, for i have been brought down very low at sea;my provisions ran short, and therefore i am still weak."
they all held their peace except king alcinous, who began, "sir,we have had much pleasure in hearing all that you have told us, fromwhich i understand that you are willing to show your prowess, ashaving been displeased with some insolent remarks that have beenmade to you by one of our athletes, and which could never have beenuttered by any one who knows how to talk with propriety. i hope youwill apprehend my meaning, and will explain to any be one of yourchief men who may be dining with yourself and your family when you gethome, that we have an hereditary aptitude for accomplishments of allkinds. we are not particularly remarkable for our boxing, nor yet aswrestlers, but we are singularly fleet of foot and are excellentsailors. we are extremely fond of good dinners, music, and dancing; wealso like frequent changes of linen, warm baths, and good beds, sonow, please, some of you who are the best dancers set about dancing,that our guest on his return home may be able to tell his friendshow much we surpass all other nations as sailors, runners, dancers,minstrels. demodocus has left his lyre at my house, so run some one orother of you and fetch it for him."
on this a servant hurried off to bring the lyre from the king'shouse, and the nine men who had been chosen as stewards stood forward.it was their business to manage everything connected with thesports, so they made the ground smooth and marked a wide space for thedancers. presently the servant came back with demodocus's lyre, and hetook his place in the midst of them, whereon the best young dancers inthe town began to foot and trip it so nimbly that ulysses wasdelighted with the merry twinkling of their feet.
meanwhile the bard began to sing the loves of mars and venus, andhow they first began their intrigue in the house of vulcan. marsmade venus many presents, and defiled king vulcan's marriage bed, sothe sun, who saw what they were about, told vulcan. vulcan was veryangry when he heard such dreadful news, so he went to his smithybrooding mischief, got his great anvil into its place, and began toforge some chains which none could either unloose or break, so thatthey might stay there in that place. when he had finished his snare hewent into his bedroom and festooned the bed-posts all over with chainslike cobwebs; he also let many hang down from the great beam of theceiling. not even a god could see them, so fine and subtle werethey. as soon as he had spread the chains all over the bed, he made asthough he were setting out for the fair state of lemnos, which ofall places in the world was the one he was most fond of. but mars keptno blind look out, and as soon as he saw him start, hurried off to hishouse, burning with love for venus.
now venus was just come in from a visit to her father jove, andwas about sitting down when mars came inside the house, an said ashe took her hand in his own, "let us go to the couch of vulcan: heis not at home, but is gone off to lemnos among the sintians, whosespeech is barbarous."
she was nothing loth, so they went to the couch to take theirrest, whereon they were caught in the toils which cunning vulcan hadspread for them, and could neither get up nor stir hand or foot, butfound too late that they were in a trap. then vulcan came up tothem, for he had turned back before reaching lemnos, when his scoutthe sun told him what was going on. he was in a furious passion, andstood in the vestibule making a dreadful noise as he shouted to allthe gods.
"father jove," he cried, "and all you other blessed gods who livefor ever, come here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sightthat i will show you. jove's daughter venus is always dishonouringme because i am lame. she is in love with mars, who is handsome andclean built, whereas i am a cripple- but my parents are to blame forthat, not i; they ought never to have begotten me. come and see thepair together asleep on my bed. it makes me furious to look at them.they are very fond of one another, but i do not think they will liethere longer than they can help, nor do i think that they will sleepmuch; there, however, they shall stay till her father has repaid methe sum i gave him for his baggage of a daughter, who is fair butnot honest."
on this the gods gathered to the house of vulcan. earth-encirclingneptune came, and mercury the bringer of luck, and king apollo, butthe goddesses stayed at home all of them for shame. then the givers ofall good things stood in the doorway, and the blessed gods roared withinextinguishable laughter, as they saw how cunning vulcan had been,whereon one would turn towards his neighbour saying:
"ill deeds do not prosper, and the weak confound the strong. see howlimping vulcan, lame as he is, has caught mars who is the fleetest godin heaven; and now mars will be cast in heavy damages."
thus did they converse, but king apollo said to mercury,"messenger mercury, giver of good things, you would not care howstrong the chains were, would you, if you could sleep with venus?"
"king apollo," answered mercury, "i only wish i might get thechance, though there were three times as many chains- and you mightlook on, all of you, gods and goddesses, but would sleep with her if icould."
the immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him, butneptune took it all seriously, and kept on imploring vulcan to setmars free again. "let him go," he cried, "and i will undertake, as yourequire, that he shall pay you all the damages that are heldreasonable among the immortal gods."
"do not," replied vulcan, "ask me to do this; a bad man's bond isbad security; what remedy could i enforce against you if mars shouldgo away and leave his debts behind him along with his chains?"
"vulcan," said neptune, "if mars goes away without paying hisdamages, i will pay you myself." so vulcan answered, "in this case icannot and must not refuse you."
thereon he loosed the bonds that bound them, and as soon as theywere free they scampered off, mars to thrace and laughter-loving venusto cyprus and to paphos, where is her grove and her altar fragrantwith burnt offerings. here the graces hathed her, and anointed herwith oil of ambrosia such as the immortal gods make use of, and theyclothed her in raiment of the most enchanting beauty.
thus sang the bard, and both ulysses and the seafaring phaeacianswere charmed as they heard him.
then alcinous told laodamas and halius to dance alone, for there wasno one to compete with them. so they took a red ball which polybus hadmade for them, and one of them bent himself backwards and threw itup towards the clouds, while the other jumped from off the groundand caught it with ease before it came down again. when they haddone throwing the ball straight up into the air they began to dance,and at the same time kept on throwing it backwards and forwards to oneanother, while all the young men in the ring applauded and made agreat stamping with their feet. then ulysses said:
"king alcinous, you said your people were the nimblest dancers inthe world, and indeed they have proved themselves to be so. i wasastonished as i saw them."
the king was delighted at this, and exclaimed to the phaecians"aldermen and town councillors, our guest seems to be a person ofsingular judgement; let us give him such proof of our hospitality ashe may reasonably expect. there are twelve chief men among you, andcounting myself there are thirteen; contribute, each of you, a cleancloak, a shirt, and a talent of fine gold; let us give him all this ina lump down at once, so that when he gets his supper he may do so witha light heart. as for euryalus he will have to make a formal apologyand a present too, for he has been rude."
thus did he speak. the others all of them applauded his saying,and sent their servants to fetch the presents. then euryalus said,"king alcinous, i will give the stranger all the satisfaction yourequire. he shall have sword, which is of bronze, all but the hilt,which is of silver. i will also give him the scabbard of newly sawnivory into which it fits. it will be worth a great deal to him."
as he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of ulysses and said,"good luck to you, father stranger; if anything has been said amissmay the winds blow it away with them, and may heaven grant you asafe return, for i understand you have been long away from home, andhave gone through much hardship."
to which ulysses answered, "good luck to you too my friend, andmay the gods grant you every happiness. i hope you will not miss thesword you have given me along with your apology."
with these words he girded the sword about his shoulders and towardssundown the presents began to make their appearance, as the servantsof the donors kept bringing them to the house of king alcinous; herehis sons received them, and placed them under their mother's charge.then alcinous led the way to the house and bade his guests taketheir seats.
"wife," said he, turning to queen arete, "go, fetch the best chestwe have, and put a clean cloak and shirt in it. also, set a copperon the fire and heat some water; our guest will take a warm bath;see also to the careful packing of the presents that the noblephaeacians have made him; he will thus better enjoy both his supperand the singing that will follow. i shall myself give him thisgolden goblet- which is of exquisite workmanship- that he may bereminded of me for the rest of his life whenever he makes adrink-offering to jove, or to any of the gods."
then arete told her maids to set a large tripod upon the fire asfast as they could, whereon they set a tripod full of bath water on toa clear fire; they threw on sticks to make it blaze, and the waterbecame hot as the flame played about the belly of the tripod.meanwhile arete brought a magnificent chest her own room, and insideit she packed all the beautiful presents of gold and raiment which thephaeacians had brought. lastly she added a cloak and a good shirt fromalcinous, and said to ulysses:
"see to the lid yourself, and have the whole bound round at once,for fear any one should rob you by the way when you are asleep in yourship."
when ulysses heard this he put the lid on the chest and made it fastwith a bond that circe had taught him. he had done so before anupper servant told him to come to the bath and wash himself. he wasvery glad of a warm bath, for he had had no one to wait upon himever since he left the house of calypso, who as long as he remainedwith her had taken as good care of him as though he had been a god.when the servants had done washing and anointing him with oil, and hadgiven him a clean cloak and shirt, he left the bath room and joinedthe guests who were sitting over their wine. lovely nausicaa stoodby one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof if the cloister, andadmired him as she saw him pass. "farewell stranger," said she, "donot forget me when you are safe at home again, for it is to me firstthat you owe a ransom for having saved your life."
and ulysses said, "nausicaa, daughter of great alcinous, may jovethe mighty husband of juno, grant that i may reach my home; so shall ibless you as my guardian angel all my days, for it was you who savedme."
when he had said this, he seated himself beside alcinous. supper wasthen served, and the wine was mixed for drinking. a servant led in thefavourite bard demodocus, and set him in the midst of the company,near one of the bearing-posts supporting the cloister, that he mightlean against it. then ulysses cut off a piece of roast pork withplenty of fat (for there was abundance left on the joint) and saidto a servant, "take this piece of pork over to demodocus and tellhim to eat it; for all the pain his lays may cause me i will salutehim none the less; bards are honoured and respected throughout theworld, for the muse teaches them their songs and loves them."
the servant carried the pork in his fingers over to demodocus, whotook it and was very much pleased. they then laid their hands on thegood things that were before them, and as soon as they had had toeat and drink, ulysses said to demodocus, "demodocus, there is noone in the world whom i admire more than i do you. you must havestudied under the muse, jove's daughter, and under apollo, soaccurately do you sing the return of the achaeans with all theirsufferings and adventures. if you were not there yourself, you musthave heard it all from some one who was. now, however, change yoursong and tell us of the wooden horse which epeus made with theassistance of minerva, and which ulysses got by stratagem into thefort of troy after freighting it with the men who afterwards sackedthe city. if you will sing this tale aright i will tell all theworld how magnificently heaven has endowed you."
the bard inspired of heaven took up the story at the point wheresome of the argives set fire to their tents and sailed away whileothers, hidden within the horse, were waiting with ulysses in thetrojan place of assembly. for the trojans themselves had drawn thehorse into their fortress, and it stood there while they sat incouncil round it, and were in three minds as to what they should do.some were for breaking it up then and there; others would have itdragged to the top of the rock on which the fortress stood, and thenthrown down the precipice; while yet others were for letting it remainas an offering and propitiation for the gods. and this was how theysettled it in the end, for the city was doomed when it took in thathorse, within which were all the bravest of the argives waiting tobring death and destruction on the trojans. anon he sang how thesons of the achaeans issued from the horse, and sacked the town,breaking out from their ambuscade. he sang how they over ran thecity hither and thither and ravaged it, and how ulysses went raginglike mars along with menelaus to the house of deiphobus. it wasthere that the fight raged most furiously, nevertheless by minerva'shelp he was victorious.
all this he told, but ulysses was overcome as he heard him, andhis cheeks were wet with tears. he wept as a woman weeps when shethrows herself on the body of her husband who has fallen before hisown city and people, fighting bravely in defence of his home andchildren. she screams aloud and flings her arms about him as he liesgasping for breath and dying, but her enemies beat her from behindabout the back and shoulders, and carry her off into slavery, to alife of labour and sorrow, and the beauty fades from her cheeks-even so piteously did ulysses weep, but none of those presentperceived his tears except alcinous, who was sitting near him, andcould hear the sobs and sighs that he was heaving. the king,therefore, at once rose and said:
"aldermen and town councillors of the phaeacians, let demodocuscease his song, for there are those present who do not seem to likeit. from the moment that we had done supper and demodocus began tosing, our guest has been all the time groaning and lamenting. he isevidently in great trouble, so let the bard leave off, that we may allenjoy ourselves, hosts and guest alike. this will be much more as itshould be, for all these festivities, with the escort and the presentsthat we are making with so much good will, are wholly in his honour,and any one with even a moderate amount of right feeling knows that heought to treat a guest and a suppliant as though he were his ownbrother.
"therefore, sir, do you on your part affect no more concealmentnor reserve in the matter about which i shall ask you; it will be morepolite in you to give me a plain answer; tell me the name by whichyour father and mother over yonder used to call you, and by whichyou were known among your neighbours and fellow-citizens. there isno one, neither rich nor poor, who is absolutely without any namewhatever, for people's fathers and mothers give them names as soonas they are born. tell me also your country, nation, and city, thatour ships may shape their purpose accordingly and take you there.for the phaeacians have no pilots; their vessels have no rudders asthose of other nations have, but the ships themselves understandwhat it is that we are thinking about and want; they know all thecities and countries in the whole world, and can traverse the sea justas well even when it is covered with mist and cloud, so that thereis no danger of being wrecked or coming to any harm. still i doremember hearing my father say that neptune was angry with us forbeing too easy-going in the matter of giving people escorts. he saidthat one of these days he should wreck a ship of ours as it wasreturning from having escorted some one, and bury our city under ahigh mountain. this is what my used to say, but whether the god willcarry out his threat or no is a matter which he will decide forhimself.
"and now, tell me and tell me true. where have you been wandering,and in what countries have you travelled? tell us of the peoplesthemselves, and of their cities- who were hostile, savage anduncivilized, and who, on the other hand, hospitable and humane. tellus also why you are made unhappy on hearing about the return of theargive danaans from troy. the gods arranged all this, and sent themtheir misfortunes in order that future generations might havesomething to sing about. did you lose some brave kinsman of yourwife's when you were before troy? a son-in-law or father-in-law- whichare the nearest relations a man has outside his own flesh and blood?or was it some brave and kindly-natured comrade- for a good friendis as dear to a man as his own brother?"
book ix.
and ulysses answered, "king alcinous, it is a good thing to hear abard with such a divine voice as this man has. there is nothing betteror more delightful than when a whole people make merry together,with the guests sitting orderly to listen, while the table is loadedwith bread and meats, and the cup-bearer draws wine and fills hiscup for every man. this is indeed as fair a sight as a man can see.now, however, since you are inclined to ask the story of my sorrows,and rekindle my own sad memories in respect of them, i do not know howto begin, nor yet how to continue and conclude my tale, for the handof heaven has been laid heavily upon me.
"firstly, then, i will tell you my name that you too may know it,and one day, if i outlive this time of sorrow, may become my thereguests though i live so far away from all of you. i am ulysses sonof laertes, reknowned among mankind for all manner of subtlety, sothat my fame ascends to heaven. i live in ithaca, where there is ahigh mountain called neritum, covered with forests; and not far fromit there is a group of islands very near to one another- dulichium,same, and the wooded island of zacynthus. it lies squat on thehorizon, all highest up in the sea towards the sunset, while theothers lie away from it towards dawn. it is a rugged island, but itbreeds brave men, and my eyes know none that they better love tolook upon. the goddess calypso kept me with her in her cave, andwanted me to marry her, as did also the cunning aeaean goddesscirce; but they could neither of them persuade me, for there isnothing dearer to a man than his own country and his parents, andhowever splendid a home he may have in a foreign country, if it be farfrom father or mother, he does not care about it. now, however, i willtell you of the many hazardous adventures which by jove's will i metwith on my return from troy.
"when i had set sail thence the wind took me first to ismarus, whichis the city of the cicons. there i sacked the town and put thepeople to the sword. we took their wives and also much booty, which wedivided equitably amongst us, so that none might have reason tocomplain. i then said that we had better make off at once, but mymen very foolishly would not obey me, so they stayed there drinkingmuch wine and killing great numbers of sheep and oxen on the seashore. meanwhile the cicons cried out for help to other cicons wholived inland. these were more in number, and stronger, and they weremore skilled in the art of war, for they could fight, either fromchariots or on foot as the occasion served; in the morning, therefore,they came as thick as leaves and bloom in summer, and the hand ofheaven was against us, so that we were hard pressed. they set thebattle in array near the ships, and the hosts aimed theirbronze-shod spears at one another. so long as the day waxed and it wasstill morning, we held our own against them, though they were morein number than we; but as the sun went down, towards the time when menloose their oxen, the cicons got the better of us, and we lost halfa dozen men from every ship we had; so we got away with those thatwere left.
"thence we sailed onward with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to haveescaped death though we had lost our comrades, nor did we leave tillwe had thrice invoked each one of the poor fellows who had perished bythe hands of the cicons. then jove raised the north wind against ustill it blew a hurricane, so that land and sky were hidden in thickclouds, and night sprang forth out of the heavens. we let the shipsrun before the gale, but the force of the wind tore our sails totatters, so we took them down for fear of shipwreck, and rowed ourhardest towards the land. there we lay two days and two nightssuffering much alike from toil and distress of mind, but on themorning of the third day we again raised our masts, set sail, and tookour places, letting the wind and steersmen direct our ship. i shouldhave got home at that time unharmed had not the north wind and thecurrents been against me as i was doubling cape malea, and set meoff my course hard by the island of cythera.
"i was driven thence by foul winds for a space of nine days upon thesea, but on the tenth day we reached the land of the lotus-eater,who live on a food that comes from a kind of flower. here we landed totake in fresh water, and our crews got their mid-day meal on the shorenear the ships. when they had eaten and drunk i sent two of my companyto see what manner of men the people of the place might be, and theyhad a third man under them. they started at once, and went about amongthe lotus-eaters, who did them no hurt, but gave them to eat of thelotus, which was so delicious that those who ate of it left off caringabout home, and did not even want to go back and say what had happenedto them, but were for staying and munching lotus with thelotus-eater without thinking further of their return; nevertheless,though they wept bitterly i forced them back to the ships and madethem fast under the benches. then i told the rest to go on board atonce, lest any of them should taste of the lotus and leave off wantingto get home, so they took their places and smote the grey sea withtheir oars.
"we sailed hence, always in much distress, till we came to theland of the lawless and inhuman cyclopes. now the cyclopes neitherplant nor plough, but trust in providence, and live on such wheat,barley, and grapes as grow wild without any kind of tillage, and theirwild grapes yield them wine as the sun and the rain may grow them.they have no laws nor assemblies of the people, but live in caves onthe tops of high mountains; each is lord and master in his family, andthey take no account of their neighbours.
"now off their harbour there lies a wooded and fertile island notquite close to the land of the cyclopes, but still not far. it isoverrun with wild goats, that breed there in great numbers and arenever disturbed by foot of man; for sportsmen- who as a rule willsuffer so much hardship in forest or among mountain precipices- do notgo there, nor yet again is it ever ploughed or fed down, but it lies awilderness untilled and unsown from year to year, and has no livingthing upon it but only goats. for the cyclopes have no ships, noryet shipwrights who could make ships for them; they cannot thereforego from city to city, or sail over the sea to one another's country aspeople who have ships can do; if they had had these they would havecolonized the island, for it is a very good one, and would yieldeverything in due season. there are meadows that in some places comeright down to the sea shore, well watered and full of lusciousgrass; grapes would do there excellently; there is level land forploughing, and it would always yield heavily at harvest time, forthe soil is deep. there is a good harbour where no cables arewanted, nor yet anchors, nor need a ship be moored, but all one has todo is to beach one's vessel and stay there till the wind becomesfair for putting out to sea again. at the head of the harbour there isa spring of clear water coming out of a cave, and there are poplarsgrowing all round it.
"here we entered, but so dark was the night that some god musthave brought us in, for there was nothing whatever to be seen. a thickmist hung all round our ships; the moon was hidden behind a mass ofclouds so that no one could have seen the island if he had lookedfor it, nor were there any breakers to tell us we were close inshore before we found ourselves upon the land itself; when, however,we had beached the ships, we took down the sails, went ashore andcamped upon the beach till daybreak.
"when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, we admiredthe island and wandered all over it, while the nymphs jove's daughtersroused the wild goats that we might get some meat for our dinner. onthis we fetched our spears and bows and arrows from the ships, anddividing ourselves into three bands began to shoot the goats. heavensent us excellent sport; i had twelve ships with me, and each ship gotnine goats, while my own ship had ten; thus through the livelong dayto the going down of the sun we ate and drank our fill,- and we hadplenty of wine left, for each one of us had taken many jars fullwhen we sacked the city of the cicons, and this had not yet run out.while we were feasting we kept turning our eyes towards the land ofthe cyclopes, which was hard by, and saw the smoke of their stubblefires. we could almost fancy we heard their voices and the bleating oftheir sheep and goats, but when the sun went down and it came on dark,we camped down upon the beach, and next morning i called a council.
"'stay here, my brave fellows,' said i, 'all the rest of you,while i go with my ship and exploit these people myself: i want to seeif they are uncivilized savages, or a hospitable and humane race.'
"i went on board, bidding my men to do so also and loose thehawsers; so they took their places and smote the grey sea with theiroars. when we got to the land, which was not far, there, on the faceof a cliff near the sea, we saw a great cave overhung with laurels. itwas a station for a great many sheep and goats, and outside therewas a large yard, with a high wall round it made of stones builtinto the ground and of trees both pine and oak. this was the abodeof a huge monster who was then away from home shepherding hisflocks. he would have nothing to do with other people, but led thelife of an outlaw. he was a horrid creature, not like a human being atall, but resembling rather some crag that stands out boldly againstthe sky on the top of a high mountain.
"i told my men to draw the ship ashore, and stay where they were,all but the twelve best among them, who were to go along withmyself. i also took a goatskin of sweet black wine which had beengiven me by maron, apollo son of euanthes, who was priest of apollothe patron god of ismarus, and lived within the wooded precincts ofthe temple. when we were sacking the city we respected him, and sparedhis life, as also his wife and child; so he made me some presents ofgreat value- seven talents of fine gold, and a bowl of silver, withtwelve jars of sweet wine, unblended, and of the most exquisiteflavour. not a man nor maid in the house knew about it, but onlyhimself, his wife, and one housekeeper: when he drank it he mixedtwenty parts of water to one of wine, and yet the fragrance from themixing-bowl was so exquisite that it was impossible to refrain fromdrinking. i filled a large skin with this wine, and took a wallet fullof provisions with me, for my mind misgave me that i might have todeal with some savage who would be of great strength, and wouldrespect neither right nor law.
"we soon reached his cave, but he was out shepherding, so we wentinside and took stock of all that we could see. his cheese-rackswere loaded with cheeses, and he had more lambs and kids than his penscould hold. they were kept in separate flocks; first there were thehoggets, then the oldest of the younger lambs and lastly the veryyoung ones all kept apart from one another; as for his dairy, allthe vessels, bowls, and milk pails into which he milked, were swimmingwith whey. when they saw all this, my men begged me to let themfirst steal some cheeses, and make off with them to the ship; theywould then return, drive down the lambs and kids, put them on boardand sail away with them. it would have been indeed better if we haddone so but i would not listen to them, for i wanted to see theowner himself, in the hope that he might give me a present. when,however, we saw him my poor men found him ill to deal with.
"we lit a fire, offered some of the cheeses in sacrifice, ate othersof them, and then sat waiting till the cyclops should come in with hissheep. when he came, he brought in with him a huge load of dryfirewood to light the fire for his supper, and this he flung with sucha noise on to the floor of his cave that we hid ourselves for fearat the far end of the cavern. meanwhile he drove all the ewesinside, as well as the she-goats that he was going to milk, leavingthe males, both rams and he-goats, outside in the yards. then herolled a huge stone to the mouth of the cave- so huge that two andtwenty strong four-wheeled waggons would not be enough to draw it fromits place against the doorway. when he had so done he sat down andmilked his ewes and goats, all in due course, and then let each ofthem have her own young. he curdled half the milk and set it asidein wicker strainers, but the other half he poured into bowls that hemight drink it for his supper. when he had got through with all hiswork, he lit the fire, and then caught sight of us, whereon he said:
"'strangers, who are you? where do sail from? are you traders, or doyou sail the as rovers, with your hands against every man, and everyman's hand against you?'
"we were frightened out of our senses by his loud voice andmonstrous form, but i managed to say, 'we are achaeans on our way homefrom troy, but by the will of jove, and stress of weather, we havebeen driven far out of our course. we are the people of agamemnon, sonof atreus, who has won infinite renown throughout the whole world,by sacking so great a city and killing so many people. we thereforehumbly pray you to show us some hospitality, and otherwise make ussuch presents as visitors may reasonably expect. may your excellencyfear the wrath of heaven, for we are your suppliants, and jove takesall respectable travellers under his protection, for he is the avengerof all suppliants and foreigners in distress.'
"to this he gave me but a pitiless answer, 'stranger,' said he, 'youare a fool, or else you know nothing of this country. talk to me,indeed, about fearing the gods or shunning their anger? we cyclopes donot care about jove or any of your blessed gods, for we are ever somuch stronger than they. i shall not spare either yourself or yourcompanions out of any regard for jove, unless i am in the humour fordoing so. and now tell me where you made your ship fast when youcame on shore. was it round the point, or is she lying straight offthe land?'
"he said this to draw me out, but i was too cunning to be caughtin that way, so i answered with a lie; 'neptune,' said i, 'sent myship on to the rocks at the far end of your country, and wrecked it.we were driven on to them from the open sea, but i and those who arewith me escaped the jaws of death.'
"the cruel wretch vouchsafed me not one word of answer, but with asudden clutch he gripped up two of my men at once and dashed them downupon the ground as though they had been puppies. their brains wereshed upon the ground, and the earth was wet with their blood. thenhe tore them limb from limb and supped upon them. he gobbled them uplike a lion in the wilderness, flesh, bones, marrow, and entrails,without leaving anything uneaten. as for us, we wept and lifted up ourhands to heaven on seeing such a horrid sight, for we did not knowwhat else to do; but when the cyclops had filled his huge paunch,and had washed down his meal of human flesh with a drink of neat milk,he stretched himself full length upon the ground among his sheep,and went to sleep. i was at first inclined to seize my sword, draw it,and drive it into his vitals, but i reflected that if i did weshould all certainly be lost, for we should never be able to shift thestone which the monster had put in front of the door. so we stayedsobbing and sighing where we were till morning came.
"when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, he againlit his fire, milked his goats and ewes, all quite rightly, and thenlet each have her own young one; as soon as he had got through withall his work, he clutched up two more of my men, and began eating themfor his morning's meal. presently, with the utmost ease, he rolled thestone away from the door and drove out his sheep, but he at once putit back again- as easily as though he were merely clapping the lidon to a quiver full of arrows. as soon as he had done so he shouted,and cried 'shoo, shoo,' after his sheep to drive them on to themountain; so i was left to scheme some way of taking my revenge andcovering myself with glory.
"in the end i deemed it would be the best plan to do as follows. thecyclops had a great club which was lying near one of the sheep pens;it was of green olive wood, and he had cut it intending to use itfor a staff as soon as it should be dry. it was so huge that wecould only compare it to the mast of a twenty-oared merchant vessel oflarge burden, and able to venture out into open sea. i went up to thisclub and cut off about six feet of it; i then gave this piece to themen and told them to fine it evenly off at one end, which theyproceeded to do, and lastly i brought it to a point myself, charringthe end in the fire to make it harder. when i had done this i hid itunder dung, which was lying about all over the cave, and told themen to cast lots which of them should venture along with myself tolift it and bore it into the monster's eye while he was asleep. thelot fell upon the very four whom i should have chosen, and i myselfmade five. in the evening the wretch came back from shepherding, anddrove his flocks into the cave- this time driving them all inside, andnot leaving any in the yards; i suppose some fancy must have takenhim, or a god must have prompted him to do so. as soon as he had putthe stone back to its place against the door, he sat down, milkedhis ewes and his goats all quite rightly, and then let each have herown young one; when he had got through with all this work, hegripped up two more of my men, and made his supper off them. so i wentup to him with an ivy-wood bowl of black wine in my hands:
"'look here, cyclops,' said i, you have been eating a great dealof man's flesh, so take this and drink some wine, that you may seewhat kind of liquor we had on board my ship. i was bringing it toyou as a drink-offering, in the hope that you would take compassionupon me and further me on my way home, whereas all you do is to goon ramping and raving most intolerably. you ought to be ashamedyourself; how can you expect people to come see you any more if youtreat them in this way?'
"he then took the cup and drank. he was so delighted with thetaste of the wine that he begged me for another bowl full. 'be sokind,' he said, 'as to give me some more, and tell me your name atonce. i want to make you a present that you will be glad to have. wehave wine even in this country, for our soil grows grapes and thesun ripens them, but this drinks like nectar and ambrosia all in one.'
"i then gave him some more; three times did i fill the bowl for him,and three times did he drain it without thought or heed; then, wheni saw that the wine had got into his head, i said to him asplausibly as i could: 'cyclops, you ask my name and i will tell ityou; give me, therefore, the present you promised me; my name isnoman; this is what my father and mother and my friends have alwayscalled me.'
"but the cruel wretch said, 'then i will eat all noman's comradesbefore noman himself, and will keep noman for the last. this is thepresent that i will make him.'
as he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on theground. his great neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep tookhold upon him. presently he turned sick, and threw up both wine andthe gobbets of human flesh on which he had been gorging, for he wasvery drunk. then i thrust the beam of wood far into the embers to heatit, and encouraged my men lest any of them should turnfaint-hearted. when the wood, green though it was, was about to blaze,i drew it out of the fire glowing with heat, and my men gathered roundme, for heaven had filled their hearts with courage. we drove thesharp end of the beam into the monster's eye, and bearing upon it withall my weight i kept turning it round and round as though i wereboring a hole in a ship's plank with an auger, which two men with awheel and strap can keep on turning as long as they choose. eventhus did we bore the red hot beam into his eye, till the boiling bloodbubbled all over it as we worked it round and round, so that the steamfrom the burning eyeball scalded his eyelids and eyebrows, and theroots of the eye sputtered in the fire. as a blacksmith plunges an axeor hatchet into cold water to temper it- for it is this that givesstrength to the iron- and it makes a great hiss as he does so, eventhus did the cyclops' eye hiss round the beam of olive wood, and hishideous yells made the cave ring again. we ran away in a fright, buthe plucked the beam all besmirched with gore from his eye, andhurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and pain, shouting as he did soto the other cyclopes who lived on the bleak headlands near him; sothey gathered from all quarters round his cave when they heard himcrying, and asked what was the matter with him.
"'what ails you, polyphemus,' said they, 'that you make such anoise, breaking the stillness of the night, and preventing us frombeing able to sleep? surely no man is carrying off your sheep?surely no man is trying to kill you either by fraud or by force?
"but polyphemus shouted to them from inside the cave, 'noman iskilling me by fraud! noman is killing me by force!'
"'then,' said they, 'if no man is attacking you, you must be ill;when jove makes people ill, there is no help for it, and you hadbetter pray to your father neptune.'
"then they went away, and i laughed inwardly at the success of myclever stratagem, but the cyclops, groaning and in an agony of pain,felt about with his hands till he found the stone and took it from thedoor; then he sat in the doorway and stretched his hands in front ofit to catch anyone going out with the sheep, for he thought i might befoolish enough to attempt this.
"as for myself i kept on puzzling to think how i could best savemy own life and those of my companions; i schemed and schemed, asone who knows that his life depends upon it, for the danger was verygreat. in the end i deemed that this plan would be the best. themale sheep were well grown, and carried a heavy black fleece, so ibound them noiselessly in threes together, with some of the withies onwhich the wicked monster used to sleep. there was to be a man underthe middle sheep, and the two on either side were to cover him, sothat there were three sheep to each man. as for myself there was a ramfiner than any of the others, so i caught hold of him by the back,esconced myself in the thick wool under his belly, and flung onpatiently to his fleece, face upwards, keeping a firm hold on it allthe time.
"thus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came,but when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, themale sheep hurried out to feed, while the ewes remained bleating aboutthe pens waiting to be milked, for their udders were full to bursting;but their master in spite of all his pain felt the backs of all thesheep as they stood upright, without being sharp enough to find outthat the men were underneath their bellies. as the ram was goingout, last of all, heavy with its fleece and with the weight of mycrafty self; polyphemus laid hold of it and said:
"'my good ram, what is it that makes you the last to leave my cavethis morning? you are not wont to let the ewes go before you, but leadthe mob with a run whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain, andare the first to come home again at night; but now you lag last ofall. is it because you know your master has lost his eye, and aresorry because that wicked noman and his horrid crew have got himdown in his drink and blinded him? but i will have his life yet. ifyou could understand and talk, you would tell me where the wretch ishiding, and i would dash his brains upon the ground till they flew allover the cave. i should thus have some satisfaction for the harm athis no-good noman has done me.'
"as spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we were a little wayout from the cave and yards, i first got from under the ram's belly,and then freed my comrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat,by constantly heading them in the right direction we managed todrive them down to the ship. the crew rejoiced greatly at seeing thoseof us who had escaped death, but wept for the others whom thecyclops had killed. however, i made signs to them by nodding andfrowning that they were to hush their crying, and told them to get allthe sheep on board at once and put out to sea; so they went aboard,took their places, and smote the grey sea with their oars. then,when i had got as far out as my voice would reach, i began to jeerat the cyclops.
"'cyclops,' said i, 'you should have taken better measure of yourman before eating up his comrades in your cave. you wretch, eat upyour visitors in your own house? you might have known that your sinwould find you out, and now jove and the other gods have punishedyou.'
"he got more and more furious as he heard me, so he tore the topfrom off a high mountain, and flung it just in front of my ship sothat it was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder. thesea quaked as the rock fell into it, and the wash of the wave itraised carried us back towards the mainland, and forced us towards theshore. but i snatched up a long pole and kept the ship off, makingsigns to my men by nodding my head, that they must row for theirlives, whereon they laid out with a will. when we had got twice as faras we were before, i was for jeering at the cyclops again, but the menbegged and prayed of me to hold my tongue.
"'do not,' they exclaimed, 'be mad enough to provoke this savagecreature further; he has thrown one rock at us already which droveus back again to the mainland, and we made sure it had been thedeath of us; if he had then heard any further sound of voices he wouldhave pounded our heads and our ship's timbers into a jelly with therugged rocks he would have heaved at us, for he can throw them along way.'
"but i would not listen to them, and shouted out to him in myrage, 'cyclops, if any one asks you who it was that put your eye outand spoiled your beauty, say it was the valiant warrior ulysses, sonof laertes, who lives in ithaca.'
"on this he groaned, and cried out, 'alas, alas, then the oldprophecy about me is coming true. there was a prophet here, at onetime, a man both brave and of great stature, telemus son of eurymus,who was an excellent seer, and did all the prophesying for thecyclopes till he grew old; he told me that all this would happen to mesome day, and said i should lose my sight by the hand of ulysses. ihave been all along expecting some one of imposing presence andsuperhuman strength, whereas he turns out to be a little insignificantweakling, who has managed to blind my eye by taking advantage of me inmy drink; come here, then, ulysses, that i may make you presents toshow my hospitality, and urge neptune to help you forward on yourjourney- for neptune and i are father and son. he, if he so will,shall heal me, which no one else neither god nor man can do.'
"then i said, 'i wish i could be as sure of killing you outright andsending you down to the house of hades, as i am that it will take morethan neptune to cure that eye of yours.'
"on this he lifted up his hands to the firmament of heaven andprayed, saying, 'hear me, great neptune; if i am indeed your owntrue-begotten son, grant that ulysses may never reach his homealive; or if he must get back to his friends at last, let him do solate and in sore plight after losing all his men [let him reach hishome in another man's ship and find trouble in his house.']
"thus did he pray, and neptune heard his prayer. then he picked up arock much larger than the first, swung it aloft and hurled it withprodigious force. it fell just short of the ship, but was within alittle of hitting the end of the rudder. the sea quaked as the rockfell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised drove us onwards onour way towards the shore of the island.
"when at last we got to the island where we had left the rest of ourships, we found our comrades lamenting us, and anxiously awaitingour return. we ran our vessel upon the sands and got out of her onto the sea shore; we also landed the cyclops' sheep, and dividedthem equitably amongst us so that none might have reason tocomplain. as for the ram, my companions agreed that i should have itas an extra share; so i sacrificed it on the sea shore, and burned itsthigh bones to jove, who is the lord of all. but he heeded not mysacrifice, and only thought how he might destroy my ships and mycomrades.
"thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun wefeasted our fill on meat and drink, but when the sun went down andit came on dark, we camped upon the beach. when the child ofmorning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, i bade my men on board andloose the hawsers. then they took their places and smote the greysea with their oars; so we sailed on with sorrow in our hearts, butglad to have escaped death though we had lost our comrades.
book x.
thence we went on to the aeoli island where lives aeolus son ofhippotas, dear to the immortal gods. it is an island that floats (asit were) upon the sea, iron bound with a wall that girds it. now,aeolus has six daughters and six lusty sons, so he made the sons marrythe daughters, and they all live with their dear father and mother,feasting and enjoying every conceivable kind of luxury. all day longthe atmosphere of the house is loaded with the savour of roastingmeats till it groans again, yard and all; but by night they sleep ontheir well-made bedsteads, each with his own wife between theblankets. these were the people among whom we had now come.
"aeolus entertained me for a whole month asking me questions all thetime about troy, the argive fleet, and the return of the achaeans. itold him exactly how everything had happened, and when i said i mustgo, and asked him to further me on my way, he made no sort ofdifficulty, but set about doing so at once. moreover, he flayed me aprime ox-hide to hold the ways of the roaring winds, which he shutup in the hide as in a sack- for jove had made him captain over thewinds, and he could stir or still each one of them according to hisown pleasure. he put the sack in the ship and bound the mouth sotightly with a silver thread that not even a breath of a side-windcould blow from any quarter. the west wind which was fair for us didhe alone let blow as it chose; but it all came to nothing, for we werelost through our own folly.
"nine days and nine nights did we sail, and on the tenth day ournative land showed on the horizon. we got so close in that we couldsee the stubble fires burning, and i, being then dead beat, fellinto a light sleep, for i had never let the rudder out of my ownhands, that we might get home the faster. on this the men fell totalking among themselves, and said i was bringing back gold and silverin the sack that aeolus had given me. 'bless my heart,' would one turnto his neighbour, saying, 'how this man gets honoured and makesfriends to whatever city or country he may go. see what fine prizes heis taking home from troy, while we, who have travelled just as faras he has, come back with hands as empty as we set out with- and nowaeolus has given him ever so much more. quick- let us see what itall is, and how much gold and silver there is in the sack he gavehim.'
"thus they talked and evil counsels prevailed. they loosed the sack,whereupon the wind flew howling forth and raised a storm thatcarried us weeping out to sea and away from our own country. then iawoke, and knew not whether to throw myself into the sea or to live onand make the best of it; but i bore it, covered myself up, and laydown in the ship, while the men lamented bitterly as the fiercewinds bore our fleet back to the aeolian island.
"when we reached it we went ashore to take in water, and dinedhard by the ships. immediately after dinner i took a herald and one ofmy men and went straight to the house of aeolus, where i found himfeasting with his wife and family; so we sat down as suppliants on thethreshold. they were astounded when they saw us and said, 'ulysses,what brings you here? what god has been ill-treating you? we tookgreat pains to further you on your way home to ithaca, or whereverit was that you wanted to go to.'
"thus did they speak, but i answered sorrowfully, 'my men haveundone me; they, and cruel sleep, have ruined me. my friends, mendme this mischief, for you can if you will.'
"i spoke as movingly as i could, but they said nothing, till theirfather answered, 'vilest of mankind, get you gone at once out of theisland; him whom heaven hates will i in no wise help. be off, foryou come here as one abhorred of heaven. "and with these words he sentme sorrowing from his door.
"thence we sailed sadly on till the men were worn out with longand fruitless rowing, for there was no longer any wind to help them.six days, night and day did we toil, and on the seventh day we reachedthe rocky stronghold of lamus- telepylus, the city of thelaestrygonians, where the shepherd who is driving in his sheep andgoats [to be milked] salutes him who is driving out his flock [tofeed] and this last answers the salute. in that country a man whocould do without sleep might earn double wages, one as a herdsman ofcattle, and another as a shepherd, for they work much the same bynight as they do by day.
"when we reached the harbour we found it land-locked under steepcliffs, with a narrow entrance between two headlands. my captains tookall their ships inside, and made them fast close to one another, forthere was never so much as a breath of wind inside, but it wasalways dead calm. i kept my own ship outside, and moored it to arock at the very end of the point; then i climbed a high rock toreconnoitre, but could see no sign neither of man nor cattle, onlysome smoke rising from the ground. so i sent two of my company with anattendant to find out what sort of people the inhabitants were.
"the men when they got on shore followed a level road by which thepeople draw their firewood from the mountains into the town, tillpresently they met a young woman who had come outside to fetchwater, and who was daughter to a laestrygonian named antiphates. shewas going to the fountain artacia from which the people bring in theirwater, and when my men had come close up to her, they asked her whothe king of that country might be, and over what kind of people heruled; so she directed them to her father's house, but when they gotthere they found his wife to be a giantess as huge as a mountain,and they were horrified at the sight of her.
"she at once called her husband antiphates from the place ofassembly, and forthwith he set about killing my men. he snatched upone of them, and began to make his dinner off him then and there,whereon the other two ran back to the ships as fast as ever theycould. but antiphates raised a hue and cry after them, and thousandsof sturdy laestrygonians sprang up from every quarter- ogres, not men.they threw vast rocks at us from the cliffs as though they had beenmere stones, and i heard the horrid sound of the ships crunching upagainst one another, and the death cries of my men, as thelaestrygonians speared them like fishes and took them home to eatthem. while they were thus killing my men within the harbour i drew mysword, cut the cable of my own ship, and told my men to row with alftheir might if they too would not fare like the rest; so they laid outfor their lives, and we were thankful enough when we got into openwater out of reach of the rocks they hurled at us. as for the othersthere was not one of them left.
"thence we sailed sadly on, glad to have escaped death, though wehad lost our comrades, and came to the aeaean island, where circelives a great and cunning goddess who is own sister to the magicianaeetes- for they are both children of the sun by perse, who isdaughter to oceanus. we brought our ship into a safe harbour without aword, for some god guided us thither, and having landed we there fortwo days and two nights, worn out in body and mind. when the morningof the third day came i took my spear and my sword, and went away fromthe ship to reconnoitre, and see if i could discover signs of humanhandiwork, or hear the sound of voices. climbing to the top of ahigh look-out i espied the smoke of circe's house rising upwardsamid a dense forest of trees, and when i saw this i doubted whether,having seen the smoke, i would not go on at once and find out more,but in the end i deemed it best to go back to the ship, give the mentheir dinners, and send some of them instead of going myself.
"when i had nearly got back to the ship some god took pity upon mysolitude, and sent a fine antlered stag right into the middle of mypath. he was coming down his pasture in the forest to drink of theriver, for the heat of the sun drove him, and as he passed i struckhim in the middle of the back; the bronze point of the spear wentclean through him, and he lay groaning in the dust until the life wentout of him. then i set my foot upon him, drew my spear from the wound,and laid it down; i also gathered rough grass and rushes and twistedthem into a fathom or so of good stout rope, with which i bound thefour feet of the noble creature together; having so done i hung himround my neck and walked back to the ship leaning upon my spear, forthe stag was much too big for me to be able to carry him on myshoulder, steadying him with one hand. as i threw him down in front ofthe ship, i called the men and spoke cheeringly man by man to eachof them. 'look here my friends,' said i, 'we are not going to die somuch before our time after all, and at any rate we will not starveso long as we have got something to eat and drink on board.' on thisthey uncovered their heads upon the sea shore and admired the stag,for he was indeed a splendid fellow. then, when they had feasted theireyes upon him sufficiently, they washed their hands and began tocook him for dinner.
"thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun westayed there eating and drinking our fill, but when the sun wentdown and it came on dark, we camped upon the sea shore. when the childof morning, fingered dawn, appeared, i called a council and said,'my friends, we are in very great difficulties; listen therefore tome. we have no idea where the sun either sets or rises, so that wedo not even know east from west. i see no way out of it; nevertheless,we must try and find one. we are certainly on an island, for i went ashigh as i could this morning, and saw the sea reaching all round it tothe horizon; it lies low, but towards the middle i saw smoke risingfrom out of a thick forest of trees.'
"their hearts sank as they heard me, for they remembered how theyhad been treated by the laestrygonian antiphates, and by the savageogre polyphemus. they wept bitterly in their dismay, but there wasnothing to be got by crying, so i divided them into two companiesand set a captain over each; i gave one company to eurylochus, while itook command of the other myself. then we cast lots in a helmet, andthe lot fell upon eurylochus; so he set out with his twenty-two men,and they wept, as also did we who were left behind.
"when they reached circe's house they found it built of cutstones, on a site that could be seen from far, in the middle of theforest. there were wild mountain wolves and lions prowling all roundit- poor bewitched creatures whom she had tamed by her enchantmentsand drugged into subjection. they did not attack my men, but waggedtheir great tails, fawned upon them, and rubbed their noses lovinglyagainst them. as hounds crowd round their master when they see himcoming from dinner- for they know he will bring them something- evenso did these wolves and lions with their great claws fawn upon my men,but the men were terribly frightened at seeing such strange creatures.presently they reached the gates of the goddess's house, and as theystood there they could hear circe within, singing most beautifullyas she worked at her loom, making a web so fine, so soft, and ofsuch dazzling colours as no one but a goddess could weave. on thispolites, whom i valued and trusted more than any other of my men,said, 'there is some one inside working at a loom and singing mostbeautifully; the whole place resounds with it, let us call her and seewhether she is woman or goddess.'
"they called her and she came down, unfastened the door, and badethem enter. they, thinking no evil, followed her, all excepteurylochus, who suspected mischief and stayed outside. when she hadgot them into her house, she set them upon benches and seats and mixedthem a mess with cheese, honey, meal, and pramnian but she druggedit with wicked poisons to make them forget their homes, and whenthey had drunk she turned them into pigs by a stroke of her wand,and shut them up in her pigsties. they were like pigs-head, hair,and all, and they grunted just as pigs do; but their senses were thesame as before, and they remembered everything.
"thus then were they shut up squealing, and circe threw them someacorns and beech masts such as pigs eat, but eurylochus hurried backto tell me about the sad fate of our comrades. he was so overcome withdismay that though he tried to speak he could find no words to doso; his eyes filled with tears and he could only sob and sigh, till atlast we forced his story out of him, and he told us what hadhappened to the others.
"'we went,' said he, as you told us, through the forest, and inthe middle of it there was a fine house built with cut stones in aplace that could be seen from far. there we found a woman, or else shewas a goddess, working at her loom and singing sweetly; so the menshouted to her and called her, whereon she at once came down, openedthe door, and invited us in. the others did not suspect any mischiefso they followed her into the house, but i stayed where i was, for ithought there might be some treachery. from that moment i saw themno more, for not one of them ever came out, though i sat a long timewatching for them.'
"then i took my sword of bronze and slung it over my shoulders; ialso took my bow, and told eurylochus to come back with me and show methe way. but he laid hold of me with both his hands and spokepiteously, saying, 'sir, do not force me to go with you, but let mestay here, for i know you will not bring one of them back with you,nor even return alive yourself; let us rather see if we cannotescape at any rate with the few that are left us, for we may stillsave our lives.'
"'stay where you are, then, 'answered i, 'eating and drinking at theship, but i must go, for i am most urgently bound to do so.'
"with this i left the ship and went up inland. when i got throughthe charmed grove, and was near the great house of the enchantresscirce, i met mercury with his golden wand, disguised as a young man inthe hey-day of his youth and beauty with the down just coming upon hisface. he came up to me and took my hand within his own, saying, 'mypoor unhappy man, whither are you going over this mountain top,alone and without knowing the way? your men are shut up in circe'spigsties, like so many wild boars in their lairs. you surely do notfancy that you can set them free? i can tell you that you will neverget back and will have to stay there with the rest of them. butnever mind, i will protect you and get you out of your difficulty.take this herb, which is one of great virtue, and keep it about youwhen you go to circe's house, it will be a talisman to you againstevery kind of mischief.
"'and i will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that circe willtry to practise upon you. she will mix a mess for you to drink, andshe will drug the meal with which she makes it, but she will not beable to charm you, for the virtue of the herb that i shall give youwill prevent her spells from working. i will tell you all about it.when circe strikes you with her wand, draw your sword and springupon her as though you were goings to kill her. she will then befrightened and will desire you to go to bed with her; on this you mustnot point blank refuse her, for you want her to set your companionsfree, and to take good care also of yourself, but you make her swearsolemnly by all the blessed that she will plot no further mischiefagainst you, or else when she has got you naked she will unman you andmake you fit for nothing.'
"as he spoke he pulled the herb out of the ground an showed mewhat it was like. the root was black, while the flower was as white asmilk; the gods call it moly, and mortal men cannot uproot it, butthe gods can do whatever they like.
"then mercury went back to high olympus passing over the woodedisland; but i fared onward to the house of circe, and my heart wasclouded with care as i walked along. when i got to the gates i stoodthere and called the goddess, and as soon as she heard me she camedown, opened the door, and asked me to come in; so i followed her-much troubled in my mind. she set me on a richly decorated seat inlaidwith silver, there was a footstool also under my feet, and she mixed amess in a golden goblet for me to drink; but she drugged it, for shemeant me mischief. when she had given it me, and i had drunk itwithout its charming me, she struck she, struck me with her wand.'there now,' she cried, 'be off to the pigsty, and make your lair withthe rest of them.'
"but i rushed at her with my sword drawn as though i would kill her,whereon she fell with a loud scream, clasped my knees, and spokepiteously, saying, 'who and whence are you? from what place and peoplehave you come? how can it be that my drugs have no power to charm you?never yet was any man able to stand so much as a taste of the herb igave you; you must be spell-proof; surely you can be none other thanthe bold hero ulysses, who mercury always said would come here someday with his ship while on his way home form troy; so be it then;sheathe your sword and let us go to bed, that we may make friendsand learn to trust each other.'
"and i answered, 'circe, how can you expect me to be friendly withyou when you have just been turning all my men into pigs? and now thatyou have got me here myself, you mean me mischief when you ask me togo to bed with you, and will unman me and make me fit for nothing. ishall certainly not consent to go to bed with you unless you willfirst take your solemn oath to plot no further harm against me.'
"so she swore at once as i had told her, and when she hadcompleted her oath then i went to bed with her.
"meanwhile her four servants, who are her housemaids, set abouttheir work. they are the children of the groves and fountains, andof the holy waters that run down into the sea. one of them spread afair purple cloth over a seat, and laid a carpet underneath it.another brought tables of silver up to the seats, and set them withbaskets of gold. a third mixed some sweet wine with water in asilver bowl and put golden cups upon the tables, while the fourthshe brought in water and set it to boil in a large cauldron over agood fire which she had lighted. when the water in the cauldron wasboiling, she poured cold into it till it was just as i liked it, andthen she set me in a bath and began washing me from the cauldron aboutthe head and shoulders, to take the tire and stiffness out of mylimbs. as soon as she had done washing me and anointing me with oil,she arrayed me in a good cloak and shirt and led me to a richlydecorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a footstool also under myfeet. a maid servant then brought me water in a beautiful goldenewer and poured it into a silver basin for me to wash my hands, andshe drew a clean table beside me; an upper servant brought me breadand offered me many things of what there was in the house, and thencirce bade me eat, but i would not, and sat without heeding what wasbefore me, still moody and suspicious.
"when circe saw me sitting there without eating, and in great grief,she came to me and said, 'ulysses, why do you sit like that asthough you were dumb, gnawing at your own heart, and refusing bothmeat and drink? is it that you are still suspicious? you ought notto be, for i have already sworn solemnly that i will not hurt you.'
"and i said, 'circe, no man with any sense of what is right canthink of either eating or drinking in your house until you have sethis friends free and let him see them. if you want me to eat anddrink, you must free my men and bring them to me that i may see themwith my own eyes.'
"when i had said this she went straight through the court with herwand in her hand and opened the pigsty doors. my men came out likeso many prime hogs and stood looking at her, but she went aboutamong them and anointed each with a second drug, whereon thebristles that the bad drug had given them fell off, and they becamemen again, younger than they were before, and much taller and betterlooking. they knew me at once, seized me each of them by the hand, andwept for joy till the whole house was filled with the sound of theirhullabalooing, and circe herself was so sorry for them that she cameup to me and said, 'ulysses, noble son of laertes, go back at onceto the sea where you have left your ship, and first draw it on tothe land. then, hide all your ship's gear and property in some cave,and come back here with your men.'
"i agreed to this, so i went back to the sea shore, and found themen at the ship weeping and wailing most piteously. when they saw methe silly blubbering fellows began frisking round me as calves breakout and gambol round their mothers, when they see them coming hometo be milked after they have been feeding all day, and the homesteadresounds with their lowing. they seemed as glad to see me as thoughthey had got back to their own rugged ithaca, where they had been bornand bred. 'sir,' said the affectionate creatures, 'we are as glad tosee you back as though we had got safe home to ithaca; but tell us allabout the fate of our comrades.'
"i spoke comfortingly to them and said, 'we must draw our ship on tothe land, and hide the ship's gear with all our property in some cave;then come with me all of you as fast as you can to circe's house,where you will find your comrades eating and drinking in the midstof great abundance.'
"on this the men would have come with me at once, but eurylochustried to hold them back and said, 'alas, poor wretches that we are,what will become of us? rush not on your ruin by going to the house ofcirce, who will turn us all into pigs or wolves or lions, and we shallhave to keep guard over her house. remember how the cyclops treated uswhen our comrades went inside his cave, and ulysses with them. itwas all through his sheer folly that those men lost their lives.'
"when i heard him i was in two minds whether or no to draw thekeen blade that hung by my sturdy thigh and cut his head off inspite of his being a near relation of my own; but the men intercededfor him and said, 'sir, if it may so be, let this fellow stay here andmind the ship, but take the rest of us with you to circe's house.'
"on this we all went inland, and eurylochus was not left behindafter all, but came on too, for he was frightened by the severereprimand that i had given him.
"meanwhile circe had been seeing that the men who had been leftbehind were washed and anointed with olive oil; she had also giventhem woollen cloaks and shirts, and when we came we found them allcomfortably at dinner in her house. as soon as the men saw eachother face to face and knew one another, they wept for joy and criedaloud till the whole palace rang again. thereon circe came up to meand said, 'ulysses, noble son of laertes, tell your men to leave offcrying; i know how much you have all of you suffered at sea, and howill you have fared among cruel savages on the mainland, but that isover now, so stay here, and eat and drink till you are once more asstrong and hearty as you were when you left ithaca; for at present youare weakened both in body and mind; you keep all the time thinkingof the hardships- you have suffered during your travels, so that youhave no more cheerfulness left in you.'
"thus did she speak and we assented. we stayed with circe for awhole twelvemonth feasting upon an untold quantity both of meat andwine. but when the year had passed in the waning of moons and the longdays had come round, my men called me apart and said, 'sir, it is timeyou began to think about going home, if so be you are to be sparedto see your house and native country at all.'
"thus did they speak and i assented. thereon through the livelongday to the going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and wine,but when the sun went down and it came on dark the men laid themselvesdown to sleep in the covered cloisters. i, however, after i had gotinto bed with circe, besought her by her knees, and the goddesslistened to what i had got to say. 'circe,' said i, 'please to keepthe promise you made me about furthering me on my homeward voyage. iwant to get back and so do my men, they are always pestering me withtheir complaints as soon as ever your back is turned.'
"and the goddess answered, 'ulysses, noble son of laertes, you shallnone of you stay here any longer if you do not want to, but there isanother journey which you have got to take before you can sailhomewards. you must go to the house of hades and of dread proserpineto consult the ghost of the blind theban prophet teiresias whosereason is still unshaken. to him alone has proserpine left hisunderstanding even in death, but the other ghosts flit aboutaimlessly.'
"i was dismayed when i heard this. i sat up in bed and wept, andwould gladly have lived no longer to see the light of the sun, butpresently when i was tired of weeping and tossing myself about, isaid, 'and who shall guide me upon this voyage- for the house of hadesis a port that no ship can reach.'
"'you will want no guide,' she answered; 'raise you mast, set yourwhite sails, sit quite still, and the north wind will blow you thereof itself. when your ship has traversed the waters of oceanus, youwill reach the fertile shore of proserpine's country with its grovesof tall poplars and willows that shed their fruit untimely; here beachyour ship upon the shore of oceanus, and go straight on to the darkabode of hades. you will find it near the place where the riverspyriphlegethon and cocytus (which is a branch of the river styx)flow into acheron, and you will see a rock near it, just where the tworoaring rivers run into one another.
"'when you have reached this spot, as i now tell you, dig a trench acubit or so in length, breadth, and depth, and pour into it as adrink-offering to all the dead, first, honey mixed with milk, thenwine, and in the third place water-sprinkling white barley meal overthe whole. moreover you must offer many prayers to the poor feebleghosts, and promise them that when you get back to ithaca you willsacrifice a barren heifer to them, the best you have, and will loadthe pyre with good things. more particularly you must promise thatteiresias shall have a black sheep all to himself, the finest in allyour flocks.
"'when you shall have thus besought the ghosts with your prayers,offer them a ram and a black ewe, bending their heads towardserebus; but yourself turn away from them as though you would maketowards the river. on this, many dead men's ghosts will come to you,and you must tell your men to skin the two sheep that you have justkilled, and offer them as a burnt sacrifice with prayers to hadesand to proserpine. then draw your sword and sit there, so as toprevent any other poor ghost from coming near the split blood beforeteiresias shall have answered your questions. the seer willpresently come to you, and will tell you about your voyage- whatstages you are to make, and how you are to sail the see so as to reachyour home.'
"it was day-break by the time she had done speaking, so shedressed me in my shirt and cloak. as for herself she threw a beautifullight gossamer fabric over her shoulders, fastening it with a goldengirdle round her waist, and she covered her head with a mantle. then iwent about among the men everywhere all over the house, and spokekindly to each of them man by man: 'you must not lie sleeping here anylonger,' said i to them, 'we must be going, for circe has told meall about it.' and this they did as i bade them.
"even so, however, i did not get them away without misadventure.we had with us a certain youth named elpenor, not very remarkablefor sense or courage, who had got drunk and was lying on the house-topaway from the rest of the men, to sleep off his liquor in the cool.when he heard the noise of the men bustling about, he jumped up on asudden and forgot all about coming down by the main staircase, so hetumbled right off the roof and broke his neck, and his soul wentdown to the house of hades.
"when i had got the men together i said to them, 'you think youare about to start home again, but circe has explained to me thatinstead of this, we have got to go to the house of hades andproserpine to consult the ghost of the theban prophet teiresias.'
"the men were broken-hearted as they heard me, and threwthemselves on the ground groaning and tearing their hair, but they didnot mend matters by crying. when we reached the sea shore, weeping andlamenting our fate, circe brought the ram and the ewe, and we madethem fast hard by the ship. she passed through the midst of us withoutour knowing it, for who can see the comings and goings of a god, ifthe god does not wish to be seen?
book xi.
then, when we had got down to the sea shore we drew our ship intothe water and got her mast and sails into her; we also put the sheepon board and took our places, weeping and in great distress of mind.circe, that great and cunning goddess, sent us a fair wind that blewdead aft and stayed steadily with us keeping our sails all the timewell filled; so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship's gear andlet her go as the wind and helmsman headed her. all day long her sailswere full as she held her course over the sea, but when the sun wentdown and darkness was over all the earth, we got into the deepwaters of the river oceanus, where lie the land and city of thecimmerians who live enshrouded in mist and darkness which the raysof the sun never pierce neither at his rising nor as he goes downagain out of the heavens, but the poor wretches live in one longmelancholy night. when we got there we beached the ship, took thesheep out of her, and went along by the waters of oceanus till we cameto the place of which circe had told us.
"here perimedes and eurylochus held the victims, while i drew mysword and dug the trench a cubit each way. i made a drink-offeringto all the dead, first with honey and milk, then with wine, andthirdly with water, and i sprinkled white barley meal over thewhole, praying earnestly to the poor feckless ghosts, and promisingthem that when i got back to ithaca i would sacrifice a barrenheifer for them, the best i had, and would load the pyre with goodthings. i also particularly promised that teiresias should have ablack sheep to himself, the best in all my flocks. when i had prayedsufficiently to the dead, i cut the throats of the two sheep and letthe blood run into the trench, whereon the ghosts came trooping upfrom erebus- brides, young bachelors, old men worn out with toil,maids who had been crossed in love, and brave men who had beenkilled in battle, with their armour still smirched with blood; theycame from every quarter and flitted round the trench with a strangekind of screaming sound that made me turn pale with fear. when i sawthem coming i told the men to be quick and flay the carcasses of thetwo dead sheep and make burnt offerings of them, and at the sametime to repeat prayers to hades and to proserpine; but i sat where iwas with my sword drawn and would not let the poor feckless ghostscome near the blood till teiresias should have answered my questions.
"the first ghost 'that came was that of my comrade elpenor, for hehad not yet been laid beneath the earth. we had left his bodyunwaked and unburied in circe's house, for we had had too much else todo. i was very sorry for him, and cried when i saw him: 'elpenor,'said i, 'how did you come down here into this gloom and darkness?you have here on foot quicker than i have with my ship.'
"'sir,' he answered with a groan, 'it was all bad luck, and my ownunspeakable drunkenness. i was lying asleep on the top of circe'shouse, and never thought of coming down again by the great staircasebut fell right off the roof and broke my neck, so my soul down tothe house of hades. and now i beseech you by all those whom you haveleft behind you, though they are not here, by your wife, by the fatherwho brought you up when you were a child, and by telemachus who is theone hope of your house, do what i shall now ask you. i know thatwhen you leave this limbo you will again hold your ship for the aeaeanisland. do not go thence leaving me unwaked and unburied behind you,or i may bring heaven's anger upon you; but burn me with whateverarmour i have, build a barrow for me on the sea shore, that may tellpeople in days to come what a poor unlucky fellow i was, and plantover my grave the oar i used to row with when i was yet alive and withmy messmates.' and i said, 'my poor fellow, i will do all that youhave asked of me.'
"thus, then, did we sit and hold sad talk with one another, i on theone side of the trench with my sword held over the blood, and theghost of my comrade saying all this to me from the other side. thencame the ghost of my dead mother anticlea, daughter to autolycus. ihad left her alive when i set out for troy and was moved to tears wheni saw her, but even so, for all my sorrow i would not let her comenear the blood till i had asked my questions of teiresias.
"then came also the ghost of theban teiresias, with his goldensceptre in his hand. he knew me and said, 'ulysses, noble son oflaertes, why, poor man, have you left the light of day and come downto visit the dead in this sad place? stand back from the trench andwithdraw your sword that i may drink of the blood and answer yourquestions truly.'
"so i drew back, and sheathed my sword, whereon when he had drank ofthe blood he began with his prophecy.
"you want to know,' said he, 'about your return home, but heavenwill make this hard for you. i do not think that you will escape theeye of neptune, who still nurses his bitter grudge against you forhaving blinded his son. still, after much suffering you may get homeif you can restrain yourself and your companions when your shipreaches the thrinacian island, where you will find the sheep andcattle belonging to the sun, who sees and gives ear to everything.if you leave these flocks unharmed and think of nothing but of gettinghome, you may yet after much hardship reach ithaca; but if you harmthem, then i forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship andof your men. even though you may yourself escape, you will return inbad plight after losing all your men, [in another man's ship, andyou will find trouble in your house, which will be overrun byhigh-handed people, who are devouring your substance under the pretextof paying court and making presents to your wife.
"'when you get home you will take your revenge on these suitors; andafter you have killed them by force or fraud in your own house, youmust take a well-made oar and carry it on and on, till you come to acountry where the people have never heard of the sea and do not evenmix salt with their food, nor do they know anything about ships, andoars that are as the wings of a ship. i will give you this certaintoken which cannot escape your notice. a wayfarer will meet you andwill say it must be a winnowing shovel that you have got upon yourshoulder; on this you must fix the oar in the ground and sacrifice aram, a bull, and a boar to neptune. then go home and offer hecatombsto an the gods in heaven one after the other. as for yourself, deathshall come to you from the sea, and your life shall ebb away verygently when you are full of years and peace of mind, and your peopleshall bless you. all that i have said will come true].'
"'this,' i answered, 'must be as it may please heaven, but tell meand tell me and tell me true, i see my poor mother's ghost close byus; she is sitting by the blood without saying a word, and though i amher own son she does not remember me and speak to me; tell me, sir,how i can make her know me.'
"'that,' said he, 'i can soon do any ghost that you let taste of theblood will talk with you like a reasonable being, but if you do notlet them have any blood they will go away again.'
"on this the ghost of teiresias went back to the house of hades, forhis prophecyings had now been spoken, but i sat still where i wasuntil my mother came up and tasted the blood. then she knew me at onceand spoke fondly to me, saying, 'my son, how did you come down to thisabode of darkness while you are still alive? it is a hard thing forthe living to see these places, for between us and them there aregreat and terrible waters, and there is oceanus, which no man cancross on foot, but he must have a good ship to take him. are you allthis time trying to find your way home from troy, and have you neveryet got back to ithaca nor seen your wife in your own house?'
"'mother,' said i, 'i was forced to come here to consult the ghostof the theban prophet teiresias. i have never yet been near theachaean land nor set foot on my native country, and i have had nothingbut one long series of misfortunes from the very first day that iset out with agamemnon for ilius, the land of noble steeds, to fightthe trojans. but tell me, and tell me true, in what way did you die?did you have a long illness, or did heaven vouchsafe you a gentle easypassage to eternity? tell me also about my father, and the son whomi left behind me; is my property still in their hands, or has some oneelse got hold of it, who thinks that i shall not return to claim it?tell me again what my wife intends doing, and in what mind she is;does she live with my son and guard my estate securely, or has shemade the best match she could and married again?'
"my mother answered, 'your wife still remains in your house, but sheis in great distress of mind and spends her whole time in tears bothnight and day. no one as yet has got possession of your fine property,and telemachus still holds your lands undisturbed. he has to entertainlargely, as of course he must, considering his position as amagistrate, and how every one invites him; your father remains athis old place in the country and never goes near the town. he has nocomfortable bed nor bedding; in the winter he sleeps on the floor infront of the fire with the men and goes about all in rags, but insummer, when the warm weather comes on again, he lies out in thevineyard on a bed of vine leaves thrown anyhow upon the ground. hegrieves continually about your never having come home, and suffersmore and more as he grows older. as for my own end it was in thiswise: heaven did not take me swiftly and painlessly in my own house,nor was i attacked by any illness such as those that generally wearpeople out and kill them, but my longing to know what you were doingand the force of my affection for you- this it was that was thedeath of me.'
"then i tried to find some way of embracing my mother's ghost.thrice i sprang towards her and tried to clasp her in my arms, buteach time she flitted from my embrace as it were a dream or phantom,and being touched to the quick i said to her, 'mother, why do younot stay still when i would embrace you? if we could throw our armsaround one another we might find sad comfort in the sharing of oursorrows even in the house of hades; does proserpine want to lay astill further load of grief upon me by mocking me with a phantomonly?'
"'my son,' she answered, 'most ill-fated of all mankind, it is notproserpine that is beguiling you, but all people are like this whenthey are dead. the sinews no longer hold the flesh and bones together;these perish in the fierceness of consuming fire as soon as life hasleft the body, and the soul flits away as though it were a dream. now,however, go back to the light of day as soon as you can, and noteall these things that you may tell them to your wife hereafter.'
"thus did we converse, and anon proserpine sent up the ghosts of thewives and daughters of all the most famous men. they gathered incrowds about the blood, and i considered how i might question themseverally. in the end i deemed that it would be best to draw thekeen blade that hung by my sturdy thigh, and keep them from alldrinking the blood at once. so they came up one after the other, andeach one as i questioned her told me her race and lineage.
"the first i saw was tyro. she was daughter of salmoneus and wife ofcretheus the son of aeolus. she fell in love with the river enipeuswho is much the most beautiful river in the whole world. once when shewas taking a walk by his side as usual, neptune, disguised as herlover, lay with her at the mouth of the river, and a huge blue wavearched itself like a mountain over them to hide both woman and god,whereon he loosed her virgin girdle and laid her in a deep slumber.when the god had accomplished the deed of love, he took her hand inhis own and said, 'tyro, rejoice in all good will; the embraces of thegods are not fruitless, and you will have fine twins about this timetwelve months. take great care of them. i am neptune, so now gohome, but hold your tongue and do not tell any one.'
"then he dived under the sea, and she in due course bore peliasand neleus, who both of them served jove with all their might.pelias was a great breeder of sheep and lived in iolcus, but the otherlived in pylos. the rest of her children were by cretheus, namely,aeson, pheres, and amythaon, who was a mighty warrior and charioteer.
"next to her i saw antiope, daughter to asopus, who could boast ofhaving slept in the arms of even jove himself, and who bore him twosons amphion and zethus. these founded thebes with its seven gates,and built a wall all round it; for strong though they were theycould not hold thebes till they had walled it.
"then i saw alcmena, the wife of amphitryon, who also bore to joveindomitable hercules; and megara who was daughter to great king creon,and married the redoubtable son of amphitryon.
"i also saw fair epicaste mother of king oedipodes whose awful lotit was to marry her own son without suspecting it. he married herafter having killed his father, but the gods proclaimed the wholestory to the world; whereon he remained king of thebes, in great grieffor the spite the gods had borne him; but epicaste went to the houseof the mighty jailor hades, having hanged herself for grief, and theavenging spirits haunted him as for an outraged mother- to his ruingbitterly thereafter.
"then i saw chloris, whom neleus married for her beauty, havinggiven priceless presents for her. she was youngest daughter to amphionson of iasus and king of minyan orchomenus, and was queen in pylos.she bore nestor, chromius, and periclymenus, and she also bore thatmarvellously lovely woman pero, who was wooed by all the countryround; but neleus would only give her to him who should raid thecattle of iphicles from the grazing grounds of phylace, and this was ahard task. the only man who would undertake to raid them was a certainexcellent seer, but the will of heaven was against him, for therangers of the cattle caught him and put him in prison; neverthelesswhen a full year had passed and the same season came round again,iphicles set him at liberty, after he had expounded all the oracles ofheaven. thus, then, was the will of jove accomplished.
"and i saw leda the wife of tyndarus, who bore him two famoussons, castor breaker of horses, and pollux the mighty boxer. boththese heroes are lying under the earth, though they are still alive,for by a special dispensation of jove, they die and come to lifeagain, each one of them every other day throughout all time, andthey have the rank of gods.
"after her i saw iphimedeia wife of aloeus who boasted the embraceof neptune. she bore two sons otus and ephialtes, but both wereshort lived. they were the finest children that were ever born in thisworld, and the best looking, orion only excepted; for at nine yearsold they were nine fathoms high, and measured nine cubits round thechest. they threatened to make war with the gods in olympus, and triedto set mount ossa on the top of mount olympus, and mount pelion on thetop of ossa, that they might scale heaven itself, and they wouldhave done it too if they had been grown up, but apollo, son of leto,killed both of them, before they had got so much as a sign of hairupon their cheeks or chin.
"then i saw phaedra, and procris, and fair ariadne daughter of themagician minos, whom theseus was carrying off from crete to athens,but he did not enjoy her, for before he could do so diana killed herin the island of dia on account of what bacchus had said against her.
"i also saw maera and clymene and hateful eriphyle, who sold her ownhusband for gold. but it would take me all night if i were to nameevery single one of the wives and daughters of heroes whom i saw,and it is time for me to go to bed, either on board ship with my crew,or here. as for my escort, heaven and yourselves will see to it."
here he ended, and the guests sat all of them enthralled andspeechless throughout the covered cloister. then arete said to them:
"what do you think of this man, o phaecians? is he not tall and goodlooking, and is he not clever? true, he is my own guest, but all ofyou share in the distinction. do not he a hurry to send him away,nor niggardly in the presents you make to one who is in such greatneed, for heaven has blessed all of you with great abundance."
then spoke the aged hero echeneus who was one of the oldest menamong them, "my friends," said he, "what our august queen has justsaid to us is both reasonable and to the purpose, therefore bepersuaded by it; but the decision whether in word or deed restsultimately with king alcinous."
"the thing shall be done," exclaimed alcinous, "as surely as i stilllive and reign over the phaeacians. our guest is indeed very anxiousto get home, still we must persuade him to remain with us untilto-morrow, by which time i shall be able to get together the whole sumthat i mean to give him. as regards- his escort it will be a matterfor you all, and mine above all others as the chief person among you."
and ulysses answered, "king alcinous, if you were to bid me tostay here for a whole twelve months, and then speed me on my way,loaded with your noble gifts, i should obey you gladly and it wouldredound greatly to my advantage, for i should return fuller-handedto my own people, and should thus be more respected and beloved by allwho see me when i get back to ithaca."
"ulysses," replied alcinous, "not one of us who sees you has anyidea that you are a charlatan or a swindler. i know there are manypeople going about who tell such plausible stories that it is veryhard to see through them, but there is a style about your languagewhich assures me of your good disposition. moreover you have toldthe story of your own misfortunes, and those of the argives, as thoughyou were a practised bard; but tell me, and tell me true, whetheryou saw any of the mighty heroes who went to troy at the same timewith yourself, and perished there. the evenings are still at theirlongest, and it is not yet bed time- go on, therefore, with yourdivine story, for i could stay here listening till to-morrowmorning, so long as you will continue to tell us of your adventures."
"alcinous," answered ulysses, "there is a time for makingspeeches, and a time for going to bed; nevertheless, since you sodesire, i will not refrain from telling you the still sadder tale ofthose of my comrades who did not fall fighting with the trojans, butperished on their return, through the treachery of a wicked woman.
"when proserpine had dismissed the female ghosts in alldirections, the ghost of agamemnon son of atreus came sadly up tome,surrounded by those who had perished with him in the house ofaegisthus. as soon as he had tasted the blood he knew me, andweeping bitterly stretched out his arms towards me to embrace me;but he had no strength nor substance any more, and i too wept andpitied him as i beheld him. 'how did you come by your death,' saidi, 'king agamemnon? did neptune raise his winds and waves againstyou when you were at sea, or did your enemies make an end of you onthe mainland when you were cattle-lifting or sheep-stealing, orwhile they were fighting in defence of their wives and city?'
"'ulysses,' he answered, 'noble son of laertes, was not lost atsea in any storm of neptune's raising, nor did my foes despatch meupon the mainland, but aegisthus and my wicked wife were the deathof me between them. he asked me to his house, feasted me, and thenbutchered me most miserably as though i were a fat beast in aslaughter house, while all around me my comrades were slain like sheepor pigs for the wedding breakfast, or picnic, or gorgeous banquet ofsome great nobleman. you must have seen numbers of men killed eitherin a general engagement, or in single combat, but you never sawanything so truly pitiable as the way in which we fell in thatcloister, with the mixing-bowl and the loaded tables lying allabout, and the ground reeking with our-blood. i heard priam's daughtercassandra scream as clytemnestra killed her close beside me. i laydying upon the earth with the sword in my body, and raised my hands tokill the slut of a murderess, but she slipped away from me; shewould not even close my lips nor my eyes when i was dying, for thereis nothing in this world so cruel and so shameless as a woman when shehas fallen into such guilt as hers was. fancy murdering her ownhusband! i thought i was going to be welcomed home by my childrenand my servants, but her abominable crime has brought disgrace onherself and all women who shall come after- even on the good ones.'
"and i said, 'in truth jove has hated the house of atreus from firstto last in the matter of their women's counsels. see how many of usfell for helen's sake, and now it seems that clytemnestra hatchedmischief against too during your absence.'
"'be sure, therefore,' continued agamemnon, 'and not be too friendlyeven with your own wife. do not tell her all that you know perfectlywell yourself. tell her a part only, and keep your own counsel aboutthe rest. not that your wife, ulysses, is likely to murder you, forpenelope is a very admirable woman, and has an excellent nature. weleft her a young bride with an infant at her breast when we set outfor troy. this child no doubt is now grown up happily to man's estate,and he and his father will have a joyful meeting and embrace oneanother as it is right they should do, whereas my wicked wife didnot even allow me the happiness of looking upon my son, but killedme ere i could do so. furthermore i say- and lay my saying to yourheart- do not tell people when you are bringing your ship to ithaca,but steal a march upon them, for after all this there is no trustingwomen. but now tell me, and tell me true, can you give me any newsof my son orestes? is he in orchomenus, or at pylos, or is he atsparta with menelaus- for i presume that he is still living.'
"and i said, 'agamemnon, why do you ask me? i do not know whetheryour son is alive or dead, and it is not right to talk when one doesnot know.'
"as we two sat weeping and talking thus sadly with one another theghost of achilles came up to us with patroclus, antilochus, and ajaxwho was the finest and goodliest man of all the danaans after theson of peleus. the fleet descendant of aeacus knew me and spokepiteously, saying, 'ulysses, noble son of laertes, what deed of daringwill you undertake next, that you venture down to the house of hadesamong us silly dead, who are but the ghosts of them that can labour nomore?'
"and i said, 'achilles, son of peleus, foremost champion of theachaeans, i came to consult teiresias, and see if he could advise meabout my return home to ithaca, for i have never yet been able toget near the achaean land, nor to set foot in my own country, but havebeen in trouble all the time. as for you, achilles, no one was everyet so fortunate as you have been, nor ever will be, for you wereadored by all us argives as long as you were alive, and now that youare here you are a great prince among the dead. do not, therefore,take it so much to heart even if you are dead.'
"'say not a word,' he answered, 'in death's favour; i would ratherbe a paid servant in a poor man's house and be above ground thanking of kings among the dead. but give me news about son; is he goneto the wars and will he be a great soldier, or is this not so? tell mealso if you have heard anything about my father peleus- does hestill rule among the myrmidons, or do they show him no respectthroughout hellas and phthia now that he is old and his limbs failhim? could i but stand by his side, in the light of day, with the samestrength that i had when i killed the bravest of our foes upon theplain of troy- could i but be as i then was and go even for a shorttime to my father's house, any one who tried to do him violence orsupersede him would soon me it.'
"'i have heard nothing,' i answered, 'of peleus, but i can tellyou all about your son neoptolemus, for i took him in my own ship fromscyros with the achaeans. in our councils of war before troy he wasalways first to speak, and his judgement was unerring. nestor and iwere the only two who could surpass him; and when it came tofighting on the plain of troy, he would never remain with the bodyof his men, but would dash on far in front, foremost of them all invalour. many a man did he kill in battle- i cannot name every singleone of those whom he slew while fighting on the side of the argives,but will only say how he killed that valiant hero eurypylus son oftelephus, who was the handsomest man i ever saw except memnon; manyothers also of the ceteians fell around him by reason of a woman'sbribes. moreover, when all the bravest of the argives went insidethe horse that epeus had made, and it was left to me to settle when weshould either open the door of our ambuscade, or close it, thoughall the other leaders and chief men among the danaans were dryingtheir eyes and quaking in every limb, i never once saw him turn palenor wipe a tear from his cheek; he was all the time urging me to breakout from the horse- grasping the handle of his sword and hisbronze-shod spear, and breathing fury against the foe. yet when we hadsacked the city of priam he got his handsome share of the prizemoney and went on board (such is the fortune of war) without a woundupon him, neither from a thrown spear nor in close combat, for therage of mars is a matter of great chance.'
"when i had told him this, the ghost of achilles strode off across ameadow full of asphodel, exulting over what i had said concerningthe prowess of his son.
"the ghosts of other dead men stood near me and told me each his ownmelancholy tale; but that of ajax son of telamon alone held aloof-still angry with me for having won the cause in our dispute aboutthe armour of achilles. thetis had offered it as a prize, but thetrojan prisoners and minerva were the judges. would that i had nevergained the day in such a contest, for it cost the life of ajax, whowas foremost of all the danaans after the son of peleus, alike instature and prowess.
"when i saw him i tried to pacify him and said, 'ajax, will younot forget and forgive even in death, but must the judgement aboutthat hateful armour still rankle with you? it cost us argives dearenough to lose such a tower of strength as you were to us. wemourned you as much as we mourned achilles son of peleus himself,nor can the blame be laid on anything but on the spite which jove boreagainst the danaans, for it was this that made him counsel yourdestruction- come hither, therefore, bring your proud spirit intosubjection, and hear what i can tell you.'
"he would not answer, but turned away to erebus and to the otherghosts; nevertheless, i should have made him talk to me in spite ofhis being so angry, or i should have gone talking to him, only thatthere were still others among the dead whom i desired to see.
"then i saw minos son of jove with his golden sceptre in his handsitting in judgement on the dead, and the ghosts were gathered sittingand standing round him in the spacious house of hades, to learn hissentences upon them.
"after him i saw huge orion in a meadow full of asphodel driving theghosts of the wild beasts that he had killed upon the mountains, andhe had a great bronze club in his hand, unbreakable for ever and ever.
"and i saw tityus son of gaia stretched upon the plain andcovering some nine acres of ground. two vultures on either side of himwere digging their beaks into his liver, and he kept on trying to beatthem off with his hands, but could not; for he had violated jove'smistress leto as she was going through panopeus on her way to pytho.
"i saw also the dreadful fate of tantalus, who stood in a lakethat reached his chin; he was dying to quench his thirst, but couldnever reach the water, for whenever the poor creature stooped todrink, it dried up and vanished, so that there was nothing but dryground- parched by the spite of heaven. there were tall trees,moreover, that shed their fruit over his head- pears, pomegranates,apples, sweet figs and juicy olives, but whenever the poor creaturestretched out his hand to take some, the wind tossed the branches backagain to the clouds.
"and i saw sisyphus at his endless task raising his prodigious stonewith both his hands. with hands and feet he' tried to roll it up tothe top of the hill, but always, just before he could roll it overon to the other side, its weight would be too much for him, and thepitiless stone would come thundering down again on to the plain.then he would begin trying to push it up hill again, and the sweat ranoff him and the steam rose after him.
"after him i saw mighty hercules, but it was his phantom only, forhe is feasting ever with the immortal gods, and has lovely hebe towife, who is daughter of jove and juno. the ghosts were screaminground him like scared birds flying all whithers. he looked black asnight with his bare bow in his hands and his arrow on the string,glaring around as though ever on the point of taking aim. about hisbreast there was a wondrous golden belt adorned in the most marvellousfashion with bears, wild boars, and lions with gleaming eyes; therewas also war, battle, and death. the man who made that belt, do whathe might, would never be able to make another like it. hercules knewme at once when he saw me, and spoke piteously, saying, my poorulysses, noble son of laertes, are you too leading the same sorry kindof life that i did when i was above ground? i was son of jove, but iwent through an infinity of suffering, for i became bondsman to onewho was far beneath me- a low fellow who set me all manner of labours.he once sent me here to fetch the hell-hound- for he did not thinkhe could find anything harder for me than this, but i got the houndout of hades and brought him to him, for mercury and minerva helpedme.'
"on this hercules went down again into the house of hades, but istayed where i was in case some other of the mighty dead should cometo me. and i should have seen still other of them that are gonebefore, whom i would fain have seen- theseus and pirithous gloriouschildren of the gods, but so many thousands of ghosts came round meand uttered such appalling cries, that i was panic stricken lestproserpine should send up from the house of hades the head of thatawful monster gorgon. on this i hastened back to my ship and orderedmy men to go on board at once and loose the hawsers; so theyembarked and took their places, whereon the ship went down thestream of the river oceanus. we had to row at first, but presently afair wind sprang up.
book xii.
"after we were clear of the river oceanus, and had got out intothe open sea, we went on till we reached the aeaean island where thereis dawn and sunrise as in other places. we then drew our ship on tothe sands and got out of her on to the shore, where we went to sleepand waited till day should break.
"then, when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, isent some men to circe's house to fetch the body of elpenor. we cutfirewood from a wood where the headland jutted out into the sea, andafter we had wept over him and lamented him we performed his funeralrites. when his body and armour had been burned to ashes, we raiseda cairn, set a stone over it, and at the top of the cairn we fixed theoar that he had been used to row with.
"while we were doing all this, circe, who knew that we had gotback from the house of hades, dressed herself and came to us as fastas she could; and her maid servants came with her bringing us bread,meat, and wine. then she stood in the midst of us and said, 'youhave done a bold thing in going down alive to the house of hades,and you will have died twice, to other people's once; now, then,stay here for the rest of the day, feast your fill, and go on withyour voyage at daybreak tomorrow morning. in the meantime i willtell ulysses about your course, and will explain everything to himso as to prevent your suffering from misadventure either by land orsea.'
"we agreed to do as she had said, and feasted through the livelongday to the going down of the sun, but when the sun had set and it cameon dark, the men laid themselves down to sleep by the stern cablesof the ship. then circe took me by the hand and bade me be seated awayfrom the others, while she reclined by my side and asked me allabout our adventures.
"'so far so good,' said she, when i had ended my story, 'and now payattention to what i am about to tell you- heaven itself, indeed,will recall it to your recollection. first you will come to the sirenswho enchant all who come near them. if any one unwarily draws in tooclose and hears the singing of the sirens, his wife and childrenwill never welcome him home again, for they sit in a green field andwarble him to death with the sweetness of their song. there is a greatheap of dead men's bones lying all around, with the flesh stillrotting off them. therefore pass these sirens by, and stop yourmen's ears with wax that none of them may hear; but if you like youcan listen yourself, for you may get the men to bind you as youstand upright on a cross-piece half way up the mast, and they mustlash the rope's ends to the mast itself, that you may have thepleasure of listening. if you beg and pray the men to unloose you,then they must bind you faster.
"'when your crew have taken you past these sirens, i cannot give youcoherent directions as to which of two courses you are to take; i willlay the two alternatives before you, and you must consider them foryourself. on the one hand there are some overhanging rocks againstwhich the deep blue waves of amphitrite beat with terrific fury; theblessed gods call these rocks the wanderers. here not even a birdmay pass, no, not even the timid doves that bring ambrosia to fatherjove, but the sheer rock always carries off one of them, and fatherjove has to send another to make up their number; no ship that everyet came to these rocks has got away again, but the waves andwhirlwinds of fire are freighted with wreckage and with the bodiesof dead men. the only vessel that ever sailed and got through, was thefamous argo on her way from the house of aetes, and she too would havegone against these great rocks, only that juno piloted her past themfor the love she bore to jason.
"'of these two rocks the one reaches heaven and its peak is lostin a dark cloud. this never leaves it, so that the top is neverclear not even in summer and early autumn. no man though he had twentyhands and twenty feet could get a foothold on it and climb it, forit runs sheer up, as smooth as though it had been polished. in themiddle of it there is a large cavern, looking west and turnedtowards erebus; you must take your ship this way, but the cave is sohigh up that not even the stoutest archer could send an arrow into it.inside it scylla sits and yelps with a voice that you might take to bethat of a young hound, but in truth she is a dreadful monster and noone- not even a god- could face her without being terror-struck. shehas twelve mis-shapen feet, and six necks of the most prodigiouslength; and at the end of each neck she has a frightful head withthree rows of teeth in each, all set very close together, so that theywould crunch any one to death in a moment, and she sits deep withinher shady cell thrusting out her heads and peering all round the rock,fishing for dolphins or dogfish or any larger monster that she cancatch, of the thousands with which amphitrite teems. no ship everyet got past her without losing some men, for she shoots out all herheads at once, and carries off a man in each mouth.
"'you will find the other rocks lie lower, but they are so closetogether that there is not more than a bowshot between them. [alarge fig tree in full leaf grows upon it], and under it lies thesucking whirlpool of charybdis. three times in the day does shevomit forth her waters, and three times she sucks them down again; seethat you be not there when she is sucking, for if you are, neptunehimself could not save you; you must hug the scylla side and driveship by as fast as you can, for you had better lose six men thanyour whole crew.'
"'is there no way,' said i, 'of escaping charybdis, and at thesame time keeping scylla off when she is trying to harm my men?'
"'you dare-devil,' replied the goddess, you are always wanting tofight somebody or something; you will not let yourself be beateneven by the immortals. for scylla is not mortal; moreover she issavage, extreme, rude, cruel and invincible. there is no help forit; your best chance will be to get by her as fast as ever you can,for if you dawdle about her rock while you are putting on your armour,she may catch you with a second cast of her six heads, and snap upanother half dozen of your men; so drive your ship past her at fullspeed, and roar out lustily to crataiis who is scylla's dam, badluck to her; she will then stop her from making a second raid uponyou.
"'you will now come to the thrinacian island, and here you willsee many herds of cattle and flocks of sheep belonging to the sun-god-seven herds of cattle and seven flocks of sheep, with fifty head ineach flock. they do not breed, nor do they become fewer in number, andthey are tended by the goddesses phaethusa and lampetie, who arechildren of the sun-god hyperion by neaera. their mother when shehad borne them and had done suckling them sent them to thethrinacian island, which was a long way off, to live there and lookafter their father's flocks and herds. if you leave these flocksunharmed, and think of nothing but getting home, you may yet aftermuch hardship reach ithaca; but if you harm them, then i forewarnyou of the destruction both of your ship and of your comrades; andeven though you may yourself escape, you will return late, in badplight, after losing all your men.'
"here she ended, and dawn enthroned in gold began to show in heaven,whereon she returned inland. i then went on board and told my men toloose the ship from her moorings; so they at once got into her, tooktheir places, and began to smite the grey sea with their oars.presently the great and cunning goddess circe befriended us with afair wind that blew dead aft, and stayed steadily with us, keeping oursails well filled, so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship's gear,and let her go as wind and helmsman headed her.
"then, being much troubled in mind, i said to my men, 'my friends,it is not right that one or two of us alone should know the propheciesthat circe has made me, i will therefore tell you about them, sothat whether we live or die we may do so with our eyes open. first shesaid we were to keep clear of the sirens, who sit and sing mostbeautifully in a field of flowers; but she said i might hear themmyself so long as no one else did. therefore, take me and bind me tothe crosspiece half way up the mast; bind me as i stand upright,with a bond so fast that i cannot possibly break away, and lash therope's ends to the mast itself. if i beg and pray you to set mefree, then bind me more tightly still.'
"i had hardly finished telling everything to the men before wereached the island of the two sirens, for the wind had been veryfavourable. then all of a sudden it fell dead calm; there was not abreath of wind nor a ripple upon the water, so the men furled thesails and stowed them; then taking to their oars they whitened thewater with the foam they raised in rowing. meanwhile i look a largewheel of wax and cut it up small with my sword. then i kneaded the waxin my strong hands till it became soft, which it soon did betweenthe kneading and the rays of the sun-god son of hyperion. then istopped the ears of all my men, and they bound me hands and feet tothe mast as i stood upright on the crosspiece; but they went on rowingthemselves. when we had got within earshot of the land, and the shipwas going at a good rate, the sirens saw that we were getting in shoreand began with their singing.
"'come here,' they sang, 'renowned ulysses, honour to the achaeanname, and listen to our two voices. no one ever sailed past us withoutstaying to hear the enchanting sweetness of our song- and he wholistens will go on his way not only charmed, but wiser, for we knowall the ills that the gods laid upon the argives and trojans beforetroy, and can tell you everything that is going to happen over thewhole world.'
"they sang these words most musically, and as i longed to hearthem further i made by frowning to my men that they should set mefree; but they quickened their stroke, and eurylochus and perimedesbound me with still stronger bonds till we had got out of hearing ofthe sirens' voices. then my men took the wax from their ears andunbound me.
"immediately after we had got past the island i saw a great wavefrom which spray was rising, and i heard a loud roaring sound. the menwere so frightened that they loosed hold of their oars, for thewhole sea resounded with the rushing of the waters, but the shipstayed where it was, for the men had left off rowing. i went round,therefore, and exhorted them man by man not to lose heart.
"'my friends,' said i, 'this is not the first time that we have beenin danger, and we are in nothing like so bad a case as when thecyclops shut us up in his cave; nevertheless, my courage and wisecounsel saved us then, and we shall live to look back on all this aswell. now, therefore, let us all do as i say, trust in jove and row onwith might and main. as for you, coxswain, these are your orders;attend to them, for the ship is in your hands; turn her head away fromthese steaming rapids and hug the rock, or she will give you theslip and be over yonder before you know where you are, and you will bethe death of us.'
"so they did as i told them; but i said nothing about the awfulmonster scylla, for i knew the men would not on rowing if i did, butwould huddle together in the hold. in one thing only did i disobeycirce's strict instructions- i put on my armour. then seizing twostrong spears i took my stand on the ship is bows, for it was therethat i expected first to see the monster of the rock, who was to do mymen so much harm; but i could not make her out anywhere, though istrained my eyes with looking the gloomy rock all over and over
"then we entered the straits in great fear of mind, for on the onehand was scylla, and on the other dread charybdis kept sucking upthe salt water. as she vomited it up, it was like the water in acauldron when it is boiling over upon a great fire, and the sprayreached the top of the rocks on either side. when she began to suckagain, we could see the water all inside whirling round and round, andit made a deafening sound as it broke against the rocks. we couldsee the bottom of the whirlpool all black with sand and mud, and themen were at their wit's ends for fear. while we were taken up withthis, and were expecting each moment to be our last, scylla pounceddown suddenly upon us and snatched up my six best men. i was lookingat once after both ship and men, and in a moment i saw their hands andfeet ever so high above me, struggling in the air as scylla wascarrying them off, and i heard them call out my name in one lastdespairing cry. as a fisherman, seated, spear in hand, upon somejutting rock throws bait into the water to deceive the poor littlefishes, and spears them with the ox's horn with which his spear isshod, throwing them gasping on to the land as he catches them one byone- even so did scylla land these panting creatures on her rock andmunch them up at the mouth of her den, while they screamed andstretched out their hands to me in their mortal agony. this was themost sickening sight that i saw throughout all my voyages.
"when we had passed the [wandering] rocks, with scylla andterrible charybdis, we reached the noble island of the sun-god,where were the goodly cattle and sheep belonging to the sunhyperion. while still at sea in my ship i could bear the cattle lowingas they came home to the yards, and the sheep bleating. then iremembered what the blind theban prophet teiresias had told me, andhow carefully aeaean circe had warned me to shun the island of theblessed sun-god. so being much troubled i said to the men, 'my men,i know you are hard pressed, but listen while i tell you theprophecy that teiresias made me, and how carefully aeaean circe warnedme to shun the island of the blessed sun-god, for it was here, shesaid, that our worst danger would lie. head the ship, therefore,away from the island.'
"the men were in despair at this, and eurylochus at once gave mean insolent answer. 'ulysses,' said he, 'you are cruel; you are verystrong yourself and never get worn out; you seem to be made of iron,and now, though your men are exhausted with toil and want of sleep,you will not let them land and cook themselves a good supper upon thisisland, but bid them put out to sea and go faring fruitlessly onthrough the watches of the flying night. it is by night that the windsblow hardest and do so much damage; how can we escape should one ofthose sudden squalls spring up from south west or west, which so oftenwreck a vessel when our lords the gods are unpropitious? now,therefore, let us obey the of night and prepare our supper here hardby the ship; to-morrow morning we will go on board again and put outto sea.'
"thus spoke eurylochus, and the men approved his words. i saw thatheaven meant us a mischief and said, 'you force me to yield, for youare many against one, but at any rate each one of you must take hissolemn oath that if he meet with a herd of cattle or a large flockof sheep, he will not be so mad as to kill a single head of either,but will be satisfied with the food that circe has given us.'
"they all swore as i bade them, and when they had completed theiroath we made the ship fast in a harbour that was near a stream offresh water, and the men went ashore and cooked their suppers. as soonas they had had enough to eat and drink, they began talking abouttheir poor comrades whom scylla had snatched up and eaten; this setthem weeping and they went on crying till they fell off into a soundsleep.
"in the third watch of the night when the stars had shifted theirplaces, jove raised a great gale of wind that flew a hurricane so thatland and sea were covered with thick clouds, and night sprang forthout of the heavens. when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn,appeared, we brought the ship to land and drew her into a cave whereinthe sea-nymphs hold their courts and dances, and i called the mentogether in council.
"'my friends,' said i, 'we have meat and drink in the ship, let usmind, therefore, and not touch the cattle, or we shall suffer forit; for these cattle and sheep belong to the mighty sun, who seesand gives ear to everything. and again they promised that they wouldobey.
"for a whole month the wind blew steadily from the south, andthere was no other wind, but only south and east. as long as cornand wine held out the men did not touch the cattle when they werehungry; when, however, they had eaten all there was in the ship,they were forced to go further afield, with hook and line, catchingbirds, and taking whatever they could lay their hands on; for theywere starving. one day, therefore, i went up inland that i mightpray heaven to show me some means of getting away. when i had gone farenough to be clear of all my men, and had found a place that waswell sheltered from the wind, i washed my hands and prayed to allthe gods in olympus till by and by they sent me off into a sweetsleep.
"meanwhile eurylochus had been giving evil counsel to the men,'listen to me,' said he, 'my poor comrades. all deaths are badenough but there is none so bad as famine. why should not we drivein the best of these cows and offer them in sacrifice to theimmortal rods? if we ever get back to ithaca, we can build a finetemple to the sun-god and enrich it with every kind of ornament; if,however, he is determined to sink our ship out of revenge for thesehomed cattle, and the other gods are of the same mind, i for one wouldrather drink salt water once for all and have done with it, than bestarved to death by inches in such a desert island as this is.'
"thus spoke eurylochus, and the men approved his words. now thecattle, so fair and goodly, were feeding not far from the ship; themen, therefore drove in the best of them, and they all stood roundthem saying their prayers, and using young oak-shoots instead ofbarley-meal, for there was no barley left. when they had donepraying they killed the cows and dressed their carcasses; they cut outthe thigh bones, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, and set somepieces of raw meat on top of them. they had no wine with which to makedrink-offerings over the sacrifice while it was cooking, so theykept pouring on a little water from time to time while the inwardmeats were being grilled; then, when the thigh bones were burned andthey had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small and putthe pieces upon the spits.
"by this time my deep sleep had left me, and i turned back to theship and to the sea shore. as i drew near i began to smell hot roastmeat, so i groaned out a prayer to the immortal gods. 'father jove,' iexclaimed, 'and all you other gods who live in everlasting bliss,you have done me a cruel mischief by the sleep into which you havesent me; see what fine work these men of mine have been making in myabsence.'
"meanwhile lampetie went straight off to the sun and told him we hadbeen killing his cows, whereon he flew into a great rage, and saidto the immortals, 'father jove, and all you other gods who live ineverlasting bliss, i must have vengeance on the crew of ulysses' ship:they have had the insolence to kill my cows, which were the onething i loved to look upon, whether i was going up heaven or downagain. if they do not square accounts with me about my cows, i will godown to hades and shine there among the dead.'
"'sun,' said jove, 'go on shining upon us gods and upon mankind overthe fruitful earth. i will shiver their ship into little pieces with abolt of white lightning as soon as they get out to sea.'
"i was told all this by calypso, who said she had heard it fromthe mouth of mercury.
"as soon as i got down to my ship and to the sea shore i rebukedeach one of the men separately, but we could see no way out of it, forthe cows were dead already. and indeed the gods began at once toshow signs and wonders among us, for the hides of the cattle crawledabout, and the joints upon the spits began to low like cows, and themeat, whether cooked or raw, kept on making a noise just as cows do.
"for six days my men kept driving in the best cows and feasting uponthem, but when jove the son of saturn had added a seventh day, thefury of the gale abated; we therefore went on board, raised our masts,spread sail, and put out to sea. as soon as we were well away from theisland, and could see nothing but sky and sea, the son of saturnraised a black cloud over our ship, and the sea grew dark beneathit. we not get on much further, for in another moment we were caughtby a terrific squall from the west that snapped the forestays of themast so that it fell aft, while all the ship's gear tumbled about atthe bottom of the vessel. the mast fell upon the head of thehelmsman in the ship's stern, so that the bones of his head werecrushed to pieces, and he fell overboard as though he were diving,with no more life left in him.
"then jove let fly with his thunderbolts, and the ship went roundand round, and was filled with fire and brimstone as the lightningstruck it. the men all fell into the sea; they were carried about inthe water round the ship, looking like so many sea-gulls, but thegod presently deprived them of all chance of getting home again.
"i stuck to the ship till the sea knocked her sides from her keel(which drifted about by itself) and struck the mast out of her inthe direction of the keel; but there was a backstay of stoutox-thong still hanging about it, and with this i lashed the mast andkeel together, and getting astride of them was carried wherever thewinds chose to take me.
"[the gale from the west had now spent its force, and the wind gotinto the south again, which frightened me lest i should be takenback to the terrible whirlpool of charybdis. this indeed was whatactually happened, for i was borne along by the waves all night, andby sunrise had reacfied the rock of scylla, and the whirlpool. she wasthen sucking down the salt sea water, but i was carried aloft towardthe fig tree, which i caught hold of and clung on to like a bat. icould not plant my feet anywhere so as to stand securely, for theroots were a long way off and the boughs that overshadowed the wholepool were too high, too vast, and too far apart for me to reachthem; so i hung patiently on, waiting till the pool should dischargemy mast and raft again- and a very long while it seemed. a jurymanis not more glad to get home to supper, after having been longdetained in court by troublesome cases, than i was to see my raftbeginning to work its way out of the whirlpool again. at last i let gowith my hands and feet, and fell heavily into the sea, bard by my rafton to which i then got, and began to row with my hands. as for scylla,the father of gods and men would not let her get further sight ofme- otherwise i should have certainly been lost.]
"hence i was carried along for nine days till on the tenth night thegods stranded me on the ogygian island, where dwells the great andpowerful goddess calypso. she took me in and was kind to me, but ineed say no more about this, for i told you and your noble wife allabout it yesterday, and i hate saying the same thing over and overagain."
book xiii.
thus did he speak, and they all held their peace throughout thecovered cloister, enthralled by the charm of his story, till presentlyalcinous began to speak.
"ulysses," said he, "now that you have reached my house i doubtnot you will get home without further misadventure no matter howmuch you have suffered in the past. to you others, however, who comehere night after night to drink my choicest wine and listen to mybard, i would insist as follows. our guest has already packed up theclothes, wrought gold, and other valuables which you have broughtfor his acceptance; let us now, therefore, present him further, eachone of us, with a large tripod and a cauldron. we will recoupourselves by the levy of a general rate; for private individualscannot be expected to bear the burden of such a handsome present."
every one approved of this, and then they went home to bed each inhis own abode. when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn,appeared, they hurried down to the ship and brought their cauldronswith them. alcinous went on board and saw everything so securelystowed under the ship's benches that nothing could break adrift andinjure the rowers. then they went to the house of alcinous to getdinner, and he sacrificed a bull for them in honour of jove who is thelord of all. they set the steaks to grill and made an excellentdinner, after which the inspired bard, demodocus, who was afavourite with every one, sang to them; but ulysses kept on turninghis eyes towards the sun, as though to hasten his setting, for hewas longing to be on his way. as one who has been all day ploughinga fallow field with a couple of oxen keeps thinking about his supperand is glad when night comes that he may go and get it, for it isall his legs can do to carry him, even so did ulysses rejoice when thesun went down, and he at once said to the phaecians, addressinghimself more particularly to king alcinous:
"sir, and all of you, farewell. make your drink-offerings and sendme on my way rejoicing, for you have fulfilled my heart's desire bygiving me an escort, and making me presents, which heaven grant that imay turn to good account; may i find my admirable wife living in peaceamong friends, and may you whom i leave behind me give satisfaction toyour wives and children; may heaven vouchsafe you every good grace,and may no evil thing come among your people."
thus did he speak. his hearers all of them approved his saying andagreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spokenreasonably. alcinous therefore said to his servant, "pontonous, mixsome wine and hand it round to everybody, that we may offer a prayerto father jove, and speed our guest upon his way."
pontonous mixed the wine and handed it to every one in turn; theothers each from his own seat made a drink-offering to the blessedgods that live in heaven, but ulysses rose and placed the double cupin the hands of queen arete.
"farewell, queen," said he, "henceforward and for ever, till age anddeath, the common lot of mankind, lay their hands upon you. i now takemy leave; be happy in this house with your children, your people,and with king alcinous."
as he spoke he crossed the threshold, and alcinous sent a man toconduct him to his ship and to the sea shore. arete also sent somemaid servants with him- one with a clean shirt and cloak, another tocarry his strong-box, and a third with corn and wine. when they got tothe water side the crew took these things and put them on board,with all the meat and drink; but for ulysses they spread a rug and alinen sheet on deck that he might sleep soundly in the stern of theship. then he too went on board and lay down without a word, but thecrew took every man his place and loosed the hawser from the piercedstone to which it had been bound. thereon, when they began rowingout to sea, ulysses fell into a deep, sweet, and almost deathlikeslumber.
the ship bounded forward on her way as a four in hand chariotflies over the course when the horses feel the whip. her prow curvetedas it were the neck of a stallion, and a great wave of dark blue waterseethed in her wake. she held steadily on her course, and even afalcon, swiftest of all birds, could not have kept pace with her.thus, then, she cut her way through the water. carrying one who was ascunning as the gods, but who was now sleeping peacefully, forgetful ofall that he had suffered both on the field of battle and by thewaves of the weary sea.
when the bright star that heralds the approach of dawn began toshow. the ship drew near to land. now there is in ithaca a haven ofthe old merman phorcys, which lies between two points that break theline of the sea and shut the harbour in. these shelter it from thestorms of wind and sea that rage outside, so that, when once withinit, a ship may lie without being even moored. at the head of thisharbour there is a large olive tree, and at no distance a fineoverarching cavern sacred to the nymphs who are called naiads. thereare mixing-bowls within it and wine-jars of stone, and the bees hivethere. moreover, there are great looms of stone on which the nymphsweave their robes of sea purple- very curious to see- and at all timesthere is water within it. it has two entrances, one facing north bywhich mortals can go down into the cave, while the other comes fromthe south and is more mysterious; mortals cannot possibly get in byit, it is the way taken by the gods.
into this harbour, then, they took their ship, for they knew theplace, she had so much way upon her that she ran half her own lengthon to the shore; when, however, they had landed, the first thingthey did was to lift ulysses with his rug and linen sheet out of theship, and lay him down upon the sand still fast asleep. then they tookout the presents which minerva had persuaded the phaeacians to givehim when he was setting out on his voyage homewards. they put theseall together by the root of the olive tree, away from the road, forfear some passer by might come and steal them before ulysses awoke;and then they made the best of their way home again.
but neptune did not forget the threats with which he had alreadythreatened ulysses, so he took counsel with jove. "father jove,"said he, "i shall no longer be held in any sort of respect among yougods, if mortals like the phaeacians, who are my own flesh andblood, show such small regard for me. i said i would ulysses gethome when he had suffered sufficiently. i did not say that he shouldnever get home at all, for i knew you had already nodded your headabout it, and promised that he should do so; but now they have broughthim in a ship fast asleep and have landed him in ithaca afterloading him with more magnificent presents of bronze, gold, andraiment than he would ever have brought back from troy, if he hadhad his share of the spoil and got home without misadventure."
and jove answered, "what, o lord of the earthquake, are youtalking about? the gods are by no means wanting in respect for you. itwould be monstrous were they to insult one so old and honoured asyou are. as regards mortals, however, if any of them is indulging ininsolence and treating you disrespectfully, it will always rest withyourself to deal with him as you may think proper, so do just as youplease."
"i should have done so at once," replied neptune, "if i were notanxious to avoid anything that might displease you; now, therefore,i should like to wreck the phaecian ship as it is returning from itsescort. this will stop them from escorting people in future; and ishould also like to bury their city under a huge mountain."
"my good friend," answered jove, "i should recommend you at the verymoment when the people from the city are watching the ship on her way,to turn it into a rock near the land and looking like a ship. thiswill astonish everybody, and you can then bury their city under themountain."
when earth-encircling neptune heard this he went to scheria wherethe phaecians live, and stayed there till the ship, which was makingrapid way, had got close-in. then he went up to it, turned it intostone, and drove it down with the flat of his hand so as to root it inthe ground. after this he went away.
the phaeacians then began talking among themselves, and one wouldturn towards his neighbour, saying, "bless my heart, who is it thatcan have rooted the ship in the sea just as she was getting into port?we could see the whole of her only moment ago."
this was how they talked, but they knew nothing about it; andalcinous said, "i remember now the old prophecy of my father. hesaid that neptune would be angry with us for taking every one sosafely over the sea, and would one day wreck a phaeacian ship as itwas returning from an escort, and bury our city under a high mountain.this was what my old father used to say, and now it is all comingtrue. now therefore let us all do as i say; in the first place we mustleave off giving people escorts when they come here, and in the nextlet us sacrifice twelve picked bulls to neptune that he may have mercyupon us, and not bury our city under the high mountain." when thepeople heard this they were afraid and got ready the bulls.
thus did the chiefs and rulers of the phaecians to king neptune,standing round his altar; and at the same time ulysses woke up oncemore upon his own soil. he had been so long away that he did notknow it again; moreover, jove's daughter minerva had made it a foggyday, so that people might not know of his having come, and that shemight tell him everything without either his wife or his fellowcitizens and friends recognizing him until he had taken his revengeupon the wicked suitors. everything, therefore, seemed quite differentto him- the long straight tracks, the harbours, the precipices, andthe goodly trees, appeared all changed as he started up and lookedupon his native land. so he smote his thighs with the flat of hishands and cried aloud despairingly.
"alas," he exclaimed, "among what manner of people am i fallen?are they savage and uncivilized or hospitable and humane? whereshall i put all this treasure, and which way shall i go? i wish ihad stayed over there with the phaeacians; or i could have gone tosome other great chief who would have been good to me and given mean escort. as it is i do not know where to put my treasure, and icannot leave it here for fear somebody else should get hold of it.in good truth the chiefs and rulers of the phaeacians have not beendealing fairly by me, and have left me in the wrong country; they saidthey would take me back to ithaca and they have not done so: mayjove the protector of suppliants chastise them, for he watches overeverybody and punishes those who do wrong. still, i suppose i mustcount my goods and see if the crew have gone off with any of them."
he counted his goodly coppers and cauldrons, his gold and all hisclothes, but there was nothing missing; still he kept grieving aboutnot being in his own country, and wandered up and down by the shore ofthe sounding sea bewailing his hard fate. then minerva came up tohim disguised as a young shepherd of delicate and princely mien,with a good cloak folded double about her shoulders; she had sandalson her comely feet and held a javelin in her hand. ulysses was gladwhen he saw her, and went straight up to her.
"my friend," said he, "you are the first person whom i have met within this country; i salute you, therefore, and beg you to be willdisposed towards me. protect these my goods, and myself too, for iembrace your knees and pray to you as though you were a god. tellme, then, and tell me truly, what land and country is this? who areits inhabitants? am i on an island, or is this the sea board of somecontinent?"
minerva answered, "stranger, you must be very simple, or must havecome from somewhere a long way off, not to know what country thisis. it is a very celebrated place, and everybody knows it east andwest. it is rugged and not a good driving country, but it is by nomeans a bid island for what there is of it. it grows any quantity ofcorn and also wine, for it is watered both by rain and dew; itbreeds cattle also and goats; all kinds of timber grow here, and thereare watering places where the water never runs dry; so, sir, thename of ithaca is known even as far as troy, which i understand tobe a long way off from this achaean country."
ulysses was glad at finding himself, as minerva told him, in his owncountry, and he began to answer, but he did not speak the truth, andmade up a lying story in the instinctive wiliness of his heart.
"i heard of ithaca," said he, "when i was in crete beyond theseas, and now it seems i have reached it with all these treasures. ihave left as much more behind me for my children, but am flyingbecause i killed orsilochus son of idomeneus, the fleetest runner increte. i killed him because he wanted to rob me of the spoils i hadgot from troy with so much trouble and danger both on the field ofbattle and by the waves of the weary sea; he said i had not served hisfather loyally at troy as vassal, but had set myself up as anindependent ruler, so i lay in wait for him and with one of myfollowers by the road side, and speared him as he was coming into townfrom the country. my it was a very dark night and nobody saw us; itwas not known, therefore, that i had killed him, but as soon as ihad done so i went to a ship and besought the owners, who werephoenicians, to take me on board and set me in pylos or in eliswhere the epeans rule, giving them as much spoil as satisfied them.they meant no guile, but the wind drove them off their course, andwe sailed on till we came hither by night. it was all we could do toget inside the harbour, and none of us said a word about supper thoughwe wanted it badly, but we all went on shore and lay down just as wewere. i was very tired and fell asleep directly, so they took my goodsout of the ship, and placed them beside me where i was lying uponthe sand. then they sailed away to sidonia, and i was left here ingreat distress of mind."
such was his story, but minerva smiled and caressed him with herhand. then she took the form of a woman, fair, stately, and wise,"he must be indeed a shifty lying fellow," said she, "who couldsurpass you in all manner of craft even though you had a god foryour antagonist. dare-devil that you are, full of guile, unwearying indeceit, can you not drop your tricks and your instinctive falsehood,even now that you are in your own country again? we will say nomore, however, about this, for we can both of us deceive uponoccasion- you are the most accomplished counsellor and orator amongall mankind, while i for diplomacy and subtlety have no equal amongthe gods. did you not know jove's daughter minerva- me, who havebeen ever with you, who kept watch over you in all your troubles,and who made the phaeacians take so great a liking to you? and now,again, i am come here to talk things over with you, and help you tohide the treasure i made the phaeacians give you; i want to tell youabout the troubles that await you in your own house; you have got toface them, but tell no one, neither man nor woman, that you havecome home again. bear everything, and put up with every man'sinsolence, without a word."
and ulysses answered, "a man, goddess, may know a great deal, butyou are so constantly changing your appearance that when he meetsyou it is a hard matter for him to know whether it is you or not. thismuch, however, i know exceedingly well; you were very kind to me aslong as we achaeans were fighting before troy, but from the day onwhich we went on board ship after having sacked the city of priam, andheaven dispersed us- from that day, minerva, i saw no more of you, andcannot ever remember your coming to my ship to help me in adifficulty; i had to wander on sick and sorry till the godsdelivered me from evil and i reached the city of the phaeacians, whereyou encouraged me and took me into the town. and now, i beseech you inyour father's name, tell me the truth, for i do not believe i amreally back in ithaca. i am in some other country and you aremocking me and deceiving me in all you have been saying. tell methen truly, have i really got back to my own country?"
"you are always taking something of that sort into your head,"replied minerva, "and that is why i cannot desert you in yourafflictions; you are so plausible, shrewd and shifty. any one butyourself on returning from so long a voyage would at once have gonehome to see his wife and children, but you do not seem to care aboutasking after them or hearing any news about them till you haveexploited your wife, who remains at home vainly grieving for you,and having no peace night or day for the tears she sheds on yourbehalf. as for my not coming near you, i was never uneasy about you,for i was certain you would get back safely though you would loseall your men, and i did not wish to quarrel with my uncle neptune, whonever forgave you for having blinded his son. i will now, however,point out to you the lie of the land, and you will then perhapsbelieve me. this is the haven of the old merman phorcys, and here isthe olive tree that grows at the head of it; [near it is the cavesacred to the naiads;] here too is the overarching cavern in which youhave offered many an acceptable hecatomb to the nymphs, and this isthe wooded mountain neritum."
as she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared.then ulysses rejoiced at finding himself again in his own land, andkissed the bounteous soil; he lifted up his hands and prayed to thenymphs, saying, "naiad nymphs, daughters of jove, i made sure that iwas never again to see you, now therefore i greet you with allloving salutations, and i will bring you offerings as in the old days,if jove's redoubtable daughter will grant me life, and bring my son tomanhood."
"take heart, and do not trouble yourself about that," rejoinedminerva, "let us rather set about stowing your things at once in thecave, where they will be quite safe. let us see how we can best manageit all."
therewith she went down into the cave to look for the safesthiding places, while ulysses brought up all the treasure of gold,bronze, and good clothing which the phaecians had given him. theystowed everything carefully away, and minerva set a stone againstthe door of the cave. then the two sat down by the root of the greatolive, and consulted how to compass the destruction of the wickedsuitors.
"ulysses," said minerva, "noble son of laertes, think how you canlay hands on these disreputable people who have been lording it inyour house these three years, courting your wife and making weddingpresents to her, while she does nothing but lament your absence,giving hope and sending your encouraging messages to every one ofthem, but meaning the very opposite of all she says'
and ulysses answered, "in good truth, goddess, it seems i shouldhave come to much the same bad end in my own house as agamemnon did,if you had not given me such timely information. advise me how i shallbest avenge myself. stand by my side and put your courage into myheart as on the day when we loosed troy's fair diadem from her brow.help me now as you did then, and i will fight three hundred men, ifyou, goddess, will be with me."
"trust me for that," said she, "i will not lose sight of you whenonce we set about it, and i would imagine that some of those who aredevouring your substance will then bespatter the pavement with theirblood and brains. i will begin by disguising you so that no humanbeing shall know you; i will cover your body with wrinkles; youshall lose all your yellow hair; i will clothe you in a garment thatshall fill all who see it with loathing; i will blear your fine eyesfor you, and make you an unseemly object in the sight of thesuitors, of your wife, and of the son whom you left behind you. thengo at once to the swineherd who is in charge of your pigs; he has beenalways well affected towards you, and is devoted to penelope andyour son; you will find him feeding his pigs near the rock that iscalled raven by the fountain arethusa, where they are fattening onbeechmast and spring water after their manner. stay with him andfind out how things are going, while i proceed to sparta and seeyour son, who is with menelaus at lacedaemon, where he has gone to tryand find out whether you are still alive."
"but why," said ulysses, "did you not tell him, for you knew allabout it? did you want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds ofhardship while others are eating up his estate?"
minerva answered, "never mind about him, i sent him that he might bewell spoken of for having gone. he is in no sort of difficulty, but isstaying quite comfortably with menelaus, and is surrounded withabundance of every kind. the suitors have put out to sea and are lyingin wait for him, for they mean to kill him before he can get home. ido not much think they will succeed, but rather that some of those whoare now eating up your estate will first find a grave themselves."
as she spoke minerva touched him with her wand and covered himwith wrinkles, took away all his yellow hair, and withered the fleshover his whole body; she bleared his eyes, which were naturally veryfine ones; she changed his clothes and threw an old rag of a wrapabout him, and a tunic, tattered, filthy, and begrimed with smoke; shealso gave him an undressed deer skin as an outer garment, andfurnished him with a staff and a wallet all in holes, with a twistedthong for him to sling it over his shoulder.
when the pair had thus laid their plans they parted, and the goddesswent straight to lacedaemon to fetch telemachus.
book xiv.
ulysses now left the haven, and took the rough track up throughthe wooded country and over the crest of the mountain till hereached the place where minerva had said that he would find theswineherd, who was the most thrifty servant he had. he found himsitting in front of his hut, which was by the yards that he hadbuilt on a site which could be seen from far. he had made themspacious and fair to see, with a free ran for the pigs all round them;he had built them during his master's absence, of stones which hehad gathered out of the ground, without saying anything to penelope orlaertes, and he had fenced them on top with thorn bushes. outsidethe yard he had run a strong fence of oaken posts, split, and setpretty close together, while inside lie had built twelve sties nearone another for the sows to lie in. there were fifty pigs wallowing ineach sty, all of them breeding sows; but the boars slept outside andwere much fewer in number, for the suitors kept on eating them, anddie swineherd had to send them the best he had continually. there werethree hundred and sixty boar pigs, and the herdsman's four hounds,which were as fierce as wolves, slept always with them. theswineherd was at that moment cutting out a pair of sandals from a goodstout ox hide. three of his men were out herding the pigs in one placeor another, and he had sent the fourth to town with a boar that he hadbeen forced to send the suitors that they might sacrifice it andhave their fill of meat.
when the hounds saw ulysses they set up a furious barking and flewat him, but ulysses was cunning enough to sit down and loose hishold of the stick that he had in his hand: still, he would have beentorn by them in his own homestead had not the swineherd dropped his oxhide, rushed full speed through the gate of the yard and driven thedogs off by shouting and throwing stones at them. then he said toulysses, "old man, the dogs were likely to have made short work ofyou, and then you would have got me into trouble. the gods havegiven me quite enough worries without that, for i have lost the bestof masters, and am in continual grief on his account. i have to attendswine for other people to eat, while he, if he yet lives to see thelight of day, is starving in some distant land. but come inside, andwhen you have had your fill of bread and wine, tell me where youcome from, and all about your misfortunes."
on this the swineherd led the way into the hut and bade him sitdown. he strewed a good thick bed of rushes upon the floor, and on thetop of this he threw the shaggy chamois skin- a great thick one- onwhich he used to sleep by night. ulysses was pleased at being madethus welcome, and said "may jove, sir, and the rest of the godsgrant you your heart's desire in return for the kind way in whichyou have received me."
to this you answered, o swineherd eumaeus, "stranger, though a stillpoorer man should come here, it would not be right for me to insulthim, for all strangers and beggars are from jove. you must take whatyou can get and be thankful, for servants live in fear when theyhave young lords for their masters; and this is my misfortune now, forheaven has hindered the return of him who would have been alwaysgood to me and given me something of my own- a house, a piece of land,a good looking wife, and all else that a liberal master allows aservant who has worked hard for him, and whose labour the gods haveprospered as they have mine in the situation which i hold. if mymaster had grown old here he would have done great things by me, buthe is gone, and i wish that helen's whole race were utterly destroyed,for she has been the death of many a good man. it was this matter thattook my master to ilius, the land of noble steeds, to fight thetrojans in the cause of kin agamemnon."
as he spoke he bound his girdle round him and went to the stieswhere the young sucking pigs were penned. he picked out two which hebrought back with him and sacrificed. he singed them, cut them up, andspitted on them; when the meat was cooked he brought it all in and setit before ulysses, hot and still on the spit, whereon ulyssessprinkled it over with white barley meal. the swineherd then mixedwine in a bowl of ivy-wood, and taking a seat opposite ulysses toldhim to begin.
"fall to, stranger," said he, "on a dish of servant's pork. thefat pigs have to go to the suitors, who eat them up without shame orscruple; but the blessed gods love not such shameful doings, andrespect those who do what is lawful and right. even the fiercefree-booters who go raiding on other people's land, and jove givesthem their spoil- even they, when they have filled their ships and gothome again live conscience-stricken, and look fearfully for judgement;but some god seems to have told these people that ulysses is deadand gone; they will not, therefore, go back to their own homes andmake their offers of marriage in the usual way, but waste his estateby force, without fear or stint. not a day or night comes out ofheaven, but they sacrifice not one victim nor two only, and theytake the run of his wine, for he was exceedingly rich. no othergreat man either in ithaca or on the mainland is as rich as he was; hehad as much as twenty men put together. i will tell you what he had.there are twelve herds of cattle upon the mainland, and as many flocksof sheep, there are also twelve droves of pigs, while his own menand hired strangers feed him twelve widely spreading herds of goats.here in ithaca he runs even large flocks of goats on the far end ofthe island, and they are in the charge of excellent goatherds. eachone of these sends the suitors the best goat in the flock every day.as for myself, i am in charge of the pigs that you see here, and ihave to keep picking out the best i have and sending it to them."
this was his story, but ulysses went on eating and drinkingravenously without a word, brooding his revenge. when he had eatenenough and was satisfied, the swineherd took the bowl from which heusually drank, filled it with wine, and gave it to ulysses, who waspleased, and said as he took it in his hands, "my friend, who was thismaster of yours that bought you and paid for you, so rich and sopowerful as you tell me? you say he perished in the cause of kingagamemnon; tell me who he was, in case i may have met with such aperson. jove and the other gods know, but i may be able to give younews of him, for i have travelled much."
eumaeus answered, "old man, no traveller who comes here with newswill get ulysses' wife and son to believe his story. nevertheless,tramps in want of a lodging keep coming with their mouths full oflies, and not a word of truth; every one who finds his way to ithacagoes to my mistress and tells her falsehoods, whereon she takes themin, makes much of them, and asks them all manner of questions,crying all the time as women will when they have lost theirhusbands. and you too, old man, for a shirt and a cloak woulddoubtless make up a very pretty story. but the wolves and birds ofprey have long since torn ulysses to pieces, or the fishes of thesea have eaten him, and his bones are lying buried deep in sand uponsome foreign shore; he is dead and gone, and a bad business it isfor all his friends- for me especially; go where i may i shall neverfind so good a master, not even if i were to go home to my motherand father where i was bred and born. i do not so much care,however, about my parents now, though i should dearly like to see themagain in my own country; it is the loss of ulysses that grieves memost; i cannot speak of him without reverence though he is here nolonger, for he was very fond of me, and took such care of me thatwhereever he may be i shall always honour his memory."
"my friend," replied ulysses, "you are very positive, and veryhard of belief about your master's coming home again, nevertheless iwill not merely say, but will swear, that he is coming. do not give meanything for my news till he has actually come, you may then give me ashirt and cloak of good wear if you will. i am in great want, but iwill not take anything at all till then, for i hate a man, even as ihate hell fire, who lets his poverty tempt him into lying. i swearby king jove, by the rites of hospitality, and by that hearth ofulysses to which i have now come, that all will surely happen as ihave said it will. ulysses will return in this self same year; withthe end of this moon and the beginning of the next he will be hereto do vengeance on all those who are ill treating his wife and son."
to this you answered, o swineherd eumaeus, "old man, you willneither get paid for bringing good news, nor will ulysses ever comehome; drink you wine in peace, and let us talk about something else.do not keep on reminding me of all this; it always pains me when anyone speaks about my honoured master. as for your oath we will let italone, but i only wish he may come, as do penelope, his old fatherlaertes, and his son telemachus. i am terribly unhappy too aboutthis same boy of his; he was running up fast into manhood, and badefare to be no worse man, face and figure, than his father, but someone, either god or man, has been unsettling his mind, so he has goneoff to pylos to try and get news of his father, and the suitors arelying in wait for him as he is coming home, in the hope of leaving thehouse of arceisius without a name in ithaca. but let us say no moreabout him, and leave him to be taken, or else to escape if the sonof saturn holds his hand over him to protect him. and now, old man,tell me your own story; tell me also, for i want to know, who youare and where you come from. tell me of your town and parents, whatmanner of ship you came in, how crew brought you to ithaca, and fromwhat country they professed to come- for you cannot have come byland."
and ulysses answered, "i will tell you all about it. if there weremeat and wine enough, and we could stay here in the hut with nothingto do but to eat and drink while the others go to their work, icould easily talk on for a whole twelve months without everfinishing the story of the sorrows with which it has pleased heaven tovisit me.
"i am by birth a cretan; my father was a well-to-do man, who hadmany sons born in marriage, whereas i was the son of a slave whom hehad purchased for a concubine; nevertheless, my father castor son ofhylax (whose lineage i claim, and who was held in the highest honouramong the cretans for his wealth, prosperity, and the valour of hissons) put me on the same level with my brothers who had been born inwedlock. when, however, death took him to the house of hades, his sonsdivided his estate and cast lots for their shares, but to me they gavea holding and little else; nevertheless, my valour enabled me to marryinto a rich family, for i was not given to bragging, or shirking onthe field of battle. it is all over now; still, if you look at thestraw you can see what the ear was, for i have had trouble enoughand to spare. mars and minerva made me doughty in war; when i hadpicked my men to surprise the enemy with an ambuscade i never gavedeath so much as a thought, but was the first to leap forward andspear all whom i could overtake. such was i in battle, but i did notcare about farm work, nor the frugal home life of those who wouldbring up children. my delight was in ships, fighting, javelins, andarrows- things that most men shudder to think of; but one man likesone thing and another another, and this was what i was mostnaturally inclined to. before the achaeans went to troy, nine timeswas i in command of men and ships on foreign service, and i amassedmuch wealth. i had my pick of the spoil in the first instance, andmuch more was allotted to me later on.
"my house grew apace and i became a great man among the cretans, butwhen jove counselled that terrible expedition, in which so manyperished, the people required me and idomeneus to lead their shipsto troy, and there was no way out of it, for they insisted on ourdoing so. there we fought for nine whole years, but in the tenth wesacked the city of priam and sailed home again as heaven dispersed us.then it was that jove devised evil against me. i spent but one monthhappily with my children, wife, and property, and then i conceived theidea of making a descent on egypt, so i fitted out a fine fleet andmanned it. i had nine ships, and the people flocked to fill them.for six days i and my men made feast, and i found them many victimsboth for sacrifice to the gods and for themselves, but on theseventh day we went on board and set sail from crete with a fair northwind behind us though we were going down a river. nothing went illwith any of our ships, and we had no sickness on board, but satwhere we were and let the ships go as the wind and steersmen tookthem. on the fifth day we reached the river aegyptus; there istationed my ships in the river, bidding my men stay by them andkeep guard over them while i sent out scouts to reconnoitre from everypoint of vantage.
"but the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, andravaged the land of the egyptians, killing the men, and taking theirwives and children captive. the alarm was soon carried to the city,and when they heard the war cry, the people came out at daybreaktill the plain was filled with horsemen and foot soldiers and with thegleam of armour. then jove spread panic among my men, and they wouldno longer face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. theegyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do forcedlabour for them. jove, however, put it in my mind to do thus- and iwish i had died then and there in egypt instead, for there was muchsorrow in store for me- i took off my helmet and shield and dropped myspear from my hand; then i went straight up to the king's chariot,clasped his knees and kissed them, whereon he spared my life, bademe get into his chariot, and took me weeping to his own home. manymade at me with their ashen spears and tried to kil me in theirfury, but the king protected me, for he feared the wrath of jove theprotector of strangers, who punishes those who do evil.
"i stayed there for seven years and got together much money amongthe egyptians, for they all gave me something; but when it was nowgoing on for eight years there came a certain phoenician, a cunningrascal, who had already committed all sorts of villainy, and thisman talked me over into going with him to phoenicia, where his houseand his possessions lay. i stayed there for a whole twelve months, butat the end of that time when months and days had gone by till the sameseason had come round again, he set me on board a ship bound forlibya, on a pretence that i was to take a cargo along with him to thatplace, but really that he might sell me as a slave and take themoney i fetched. i suspected his intention, but went on board withhim, for i could not help it.
"the ship ran before a fresh north wind till we had reached thesea that lies between crete and libya; there, however, jove counselledtheir destruction, for as soon as we were well out from crete andcould see nothing but sea and sky, he raised a black cloud over ourship and the sea grew dark beneath it. then jove let fly with histhunderbolts and the ship went round and round and was filled withfire and brimstone as the lightning struck it. the men fell all intothe sea; they were carried about in the water round the ship lookinglike so many sea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of allchance of getting home again. i was all dismayed; jove, however,sent the ship's mast within my reach, which saved my life, for i clungto it, and drifted before the fury of the gale. nine days did idrift but in the darkness of the tenth night a great wave bore me onto the thesprotian coast. there pheidon king of the thesprotiansentertained me hospitably without charging me anything at all forhis son found me when i was nearly dead with cold and fatigue, whereonhe raised me by the hand, took me to his father's house and gave meclothes to wear.
"there it was that i heard news of ulysses, for the king told mehe had entertained him, and shown him much hospitality while he was onhis homeward journey. he showed me also the treasure of gold, andwrought iron that ulysses had got together. there was enough to keephis family for ten generations, so much had he left in the house ofking pheidon. but the king said ulysses had gone to dodona that hemight learn jove's mind from the god's high oak tree, and know whetherafter so long an absence he should return to ithaca openly, or insecret. moreover the king swore in my presence, making drink-offeringsin his own house as he did so, that the ship was by the water side,and the crew found, that should take him to his own country. he sentme off however before ulysses returned, for there happened to be athesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island of dulichium,and he told those in charge of her to be sure and take me safely toking acastus.
"these men hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me tothe very extreme of misery, for when the ship had got some way outfrom land they resolved on selling me as a slave. they stripped meof the shirt and cloak that i was wearing, and gave me instead thetattered old clouts in which you now see me; then, towardsnightfall, they reached the tilled lands of ithaca, and there theybound me with a strong rope fast in the ship, while they went on shoreto get supper by the sea side. but the gods soon undid my bonds forme, and having drawn my rags over my head i slid down the rudderinto the sea, where i struck out and swam till i was well clear ofthem, and came ashore near a thick wood in which i lay concealed. theywere very angry at my having escaped and went searching about forme, till at last they thought it was no further use and went back totheir ship. the gods, having hidden me thus easily, then took me toa good man's door- for it seems that i am not to die yet awhile."
to this you answered, o swineherd eumaeus, "poor unhappy stranger, ihave found the story of your misfortunes extremely interesting, butthat part about ulysses is not right; and you will never get me tobelieve it. why should a man like you go about telling lies in thisway? i know all about the return of my master. the gods one and all ofthem detest him, or they would have taken him before troy, or lethim die with friends around him when the days of his fighting weredone; for then the achaeans would have built a mound over his ashesand his son would have been heir to his renown, but now the stormwinds have spirited him away we know not whither.
"as for me i live out of the way here with the pigs, and never go tothe town unless when penelope sends for me on the arrival of some newsabout ulysses. then they all sit round and ask questions, both thosewho grieve over the king's absence, and those who rejoice at itbecause they can eat up his property without paying for it. for my ownpart i have never cared about asking anyone else since the time when iwas taken in by an aetolian, who had killed a man and come a longway till at last he reached my station, and i was very kind to him. hesaid he had seen ulysses with idomeneus among the cretans, refittinghis ships which had been damaged in a gale. he said ulysses wouldreturn in the following summer or autumn with his men, and that hewould bring back much wealth. and now you, you unfortunate old man,since fate has brought you to my door, do not try to flatter me inthis way with vain hopes. it is not for any such reason that i shalltreat you kindly, but only out of respect for jove the god ofhospitality, as fearing him and pitying you."
ulysses answered, "i see that you are of an unbelieving mind; i havegiven you my oath, and yet you will not credit me; let us then makea bargain, and call all the gods in heaven to witness it. if yourmaster comes home, give me a cloak and shirt of good wear, and send meto dulichium where i want to go; but if he does not come as i say hewill, set your men on to me, and tell them to throw me from yonderprecepice, as a warning to tramps not to go about the countrytelling lies."
"and a pretty figure i should cut then," replied eumaeus, both nowand hereafter, if i were to kill you after receiving you into my hutand showing you hospitality. i should have to say my prayers in goodearnest if i did; but it is just supper time and i hope my men willcome in directly, that we may cook something savoury for supper."
thus did they converse, and presently the swineherds came up withthe pigs, which were then shut up for the night in their sties, anda tremendous squealing they made as they were being driven intothem. but eumaeus called to his men and said, "bring in the best pigyou have, that i may sacrifice for this stranger, and we will taketoll of him ourselves. we have had trouble enough this long timefeeding pigs, while others reap the fruit of our labour."
on this he began chopping firewood, while the others brought in afine fat five year old boar pig, and set it at the altar. eumaeusdid not forget the gods, for he was a man of good principles, so thefirst thing he did was to cut bristles from the pig's face and throwthem into the fire, praying to all the gods as he did so thatulysses might return home again. then he clubbed the pig with a billetof oak which he had kept back when he was chopping the firewood, andstunned it, while the others slaughtered and singed it. then theycut it up, and eumaeus began by putting raw pieces from each jointon to some of the fat; these he sprinkled with barley meal, and laidupon the embers; they cut the rest of the meat up small, put thepieces upon the spits and roasted them till they were done; whenthey had taken them off the spits they threw them on to the dresser ina heap. the swineherd, who was a most equitable man, then stood upto give every one his share. he made seven portions; one of these heset apart for mercury the son of maia and the nymphs, praying tothem as he did so; the others he dealt out to the men man by man. hegave ulysses some slices cut lengthways down the loin as a mark ofespecial honour, and ulysses was much pleased. "i hope, eumaeus," saidhe, "that jove will be as well disposed towards you as i am, for therespect you are showing to an outcast like myself."
to this you answered, o swineherd eumaeus, "eat, my good fellow, andenjoy your supper, such as it is. god grants this, and withholds that,just as he thinks right, for he can do whatever he chooses."
as he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burntsacrifice to the immortal gods; then he made them a drink-offering,put the cup in the hands of ulysses, and sat down to his ownportion. mesaulius brought them their bread; the swineherd hadbought this man on his own account from among the taphians duringhis master's absence, and had paid for him with his own moneywithout saying anything either to his mistress or laertes. they thenlaid their hands upon the good things that were before them, andwhen they had had enough to eat and drink, mesaulius took away whatwas left of the bread, and they all went to bed after having made ahearty supper.
now the night came on stormy and very dark, for there was no moon.it poured without ceasing, and the wind blew strong from the west,which is a wet quarter, so ulysses thought he would see whethereumaeus, in the excellent care he took of him, would take off hisown cloak and give it him, or make one of his men give him one."listen to me," said he, "eumaeus and the rest of you; when i havesaid a prayer i will tell you something. it is the wine that makesme talk in this way; wine will make even a wise man fall to singing;it will make him chuckle and dance and say many a word that he hadbetter leave unspoken; still, as i have begun, i will go on. wouldthat i were still young and strong as when we got up an ambuscadebefore troy. menelaus and ulysses were the leaders, but i was incommand also, for the other two would have it so. when we had comeup to the wall of the city we crouched down beneath our armour and laythere under cover of the reeds and thick brush-wood that grew aboutthe swamp. it came on to freeze with a north wind blowing; the snowfell small and fine like hoar frost, and our shields were coated thickwith rime. the others had all got cloaks and shirts, and sleptcomfortably enough with their shields about their shoulders, but i hadcarelessly left my cloak behind me, not thinking that i should betoo cold, and had gone off in nothing but my shirt and shield. whenthe night was two-thirds through and the stars had shifted their theirplaces, i nudged ulysses who was close to me with my elbow, and heat once gave me his ear.
"'ulysses,' said i, 'this cold will be the death of me, for i haveno cloak; some god fooled me into setting off with nothing on but myshirt, and i do not know what to do.'
"ulysses, who was as crafty as he was valiant, hit upon thefollowing plan:
"'keep still,' said he in a low voice, 'or the others will hearyou.' then he raised his head on his elbow.
"'my friends,' said he, 'i have had a dream from heaven in my sleep.we are a long way from the ships; i wish some one would go down andtell agamemnon to send us up more men at once.'
"on this thoas son of andraemon threw off his cloak and set outrunning to the ships, whereon i took the cloak and lay in itcomfortably enough till morning. would that i were still young andstrong as i was in those days, for then some one of you swineherdswould give me a cloak both out of good will and for the respect due toa brave soldier; but now people look down upon me because my clothesare shabby."
and eumaeus answered, "old man, you have told us an excellent story,and have said nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory; for thepresent, therefore, you shall want neither clothing nor anythingelse that a stranger in distress may reasonably expect, butto-morrow morning you have to shake your own old rags about yourbody again, for we have not many spare cloaks nor shirts up here,but every man has only one. when ulysses' son comes home again he willgive you both cloak and shirt, and send you wherever you may want togo."
with this he got up and made a bed for ulysses by throwing somegoatskins and sheepskins on the ground in front of the fire. hereulysses lay down, and eumaeus covered him over with a great heavycloak that he kept for a change in case of extraordinarily badweather.
thus did ulysses sleep, and the young men slept beside him. butthe swineherd did not like sleeping away from his pigs, so he gotready to go and ulysses was glad to see that he looked after hisproperty during his master's absence. first he slung his sword overhis brawny shoulders and put on a thick cloak to keep out the wind. healso took the skin of a large and well fed goat, and a javelin in caseof attack from men or dogs. thus equipped he went to his rest wherethe pigs were camping under an overhanging rock that gave them shelterfrom the north wind.
book xv.
but minerva went to the fair city of lacedaemon to tell ulysses' sonthat he was to return at once. she found him and pisistratussleeping in the forecourt of menelaus's house; pisistratus was fastasleep, but telemachus could get no rest all night for thinking of hisunhappy father, so minerva went close up to him and said:
"telemachus, you should not remain so far away from home any longer,nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your house; theywill eat up everything you have among them, and you will have beenon a fool's errand. ask menelaus to send you home at once if youwish to find your excellent mother still there when you get back.her father and brothers are already urging her to marry eurymachus,who has given her more than any of the others, and has been greatlyincreasing his wedding presents. i hope nothing valuable may have beentaken from the house in spite of you, but you know what women are-they always want to do the best they can for the man who marries them,and never give another thought to the children of their first husband,nor to their father either when he is dead and done with. go home,therefore, and put everything in charge of the most respectablewoman servant that you have, until it shall please heaven to sendyou a wife of your own. let me tell you also of another matter whichyou had better attend to. the chief men among the suitors are lying inwait for you in the strait between ithaca and samos, and they meanto kill you before you can reach home. i do not much think they willsucceed; it is more likely that some of those who are now eating upyour property will find a grave themselves. sail night and day, andkeep your ship well away from the islands; the god who watches overyou and protects you will send you a fair wind. as soon as you getto ithaca send your ship and men on to the town, but yourself gostraight to the swineherd who has charge your pigs; he is welldisposed towards you, stay with him, therefore, for the night, andthen send him to penelope to tell her that you have got back safe frompylos."
then she went back to olympus; but telemachus stirred pisistratuswith his heel to rouse him, and said, "wake up pisistratus, and yokethe horses to the chariot, for we must set off home."
but pisistratus said, "no matter what hurry we are in we cannotdrive in the dark. it will be morning soon; wait till menelaus hasbrought his presents and put them in the chariot for us; and let himsay good-bye to us in the usual way. so long as he lives a guestshould never forget a host who has shown him kindness."
as he spoke day began to break, and menelaus, who had already risen,leaving helen in bed, came towards them. when telemachus saw him heput on his shirt as fast as he could, threw a great cloak over hisshoulders, and went out to meet him. "menelaus," said he, "let me goback now to my own country, for i want to get home."
and menelaus answered, "telemachus, if you insist on going i willnot detain you. not like to see a host either too fond of his guest ortoo rude to him. moderation is best in all things, and not letting aman go when he wants to do so is as bad as telling him to go if hewould like to stay. one should treat a guest well as long as he isin the house and speed him when he wants to leave it. wait, then, tilli can get your beautiful presents into your chariot, and till you haveyourself seen them. i will tell the women to prepare a sufficientdinner for you of what there may be in the house; it will be at oncemore proper and cheaper for you to get your dinner before settingout on such a long journey. if, moreover, you have a fancy formaking a tour in hellas or in the peloponnese, i will yoke myhorses, and will conduct you myself through all our principalcities. no one will send us away empty handed; every one will giveus something- a bronze tripod, a couple of mules, or a gold cup."
"menelaus," replied telemachus, "i want to go home at once, for wheni came away i left my property without protection, and fear that whilelooking for my father i shall come to ruin myself, or find thatsomething valuable has been stolen during my absence."
when menelaus heard this he immediately told his wife and servantsto prepare a sufficient dinner from what there might be in thehouse. at this moment eteoneus joined him, for he lived close by andhad just got up; so menelaus told him to light the fire and cooksome meat, which he at once did. then menelaus went down into hisfragrant store room, not alone, but helen went too, withmegapenthes. when he reached the place where the treasures of hishouse were kept, he selected a double cup, and told his sonmegapenthes to bring also a silver mixing-bowl. meanwhile helen wentto the chest where she kept the lovely dresses which she had made withher own hands, and took out one that was largest and mostbeautifully enriched with embroidery; it glittered like a star, andlay at the very bottom of the chest. then they all came back throughthe house again till they got to telemachus, and menelaus said,"telemachus, may jove, the mighty husband of juno, bring you safelyhome according to your desire. i will now present you with thefinest and most precious piece of plate in all my house. it is amixing-bowl of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with gold,and it is the work of vulcan. phaedimus king of the sidonians mademe a present of it in the course of a visit that i paid him while iwas on my return home. i should like to give it to you."
with these words he placed the double cup in the hands oftelemachus, while megapenthes brought the beautiful mixing-bowl andset it before him. hard by stood lovely helen with the robe ready inher hand.
"i too, my son," said she, "have something for you as a keepsakefrom the hand of helen; it is for your bride to wear upon herwedding day. till then, get your dear mother to keep it for you;thus may you go back rejoicing to your own country and to your home."
so saying she gave the robe over to him and he received it gladly.then pisistratus put the presents into the chariot, and admired themall as he did so. presently menelaus took telemachus and pisistratusinto the house, and they both of them sat down to table. a maidservant brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured itinto a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she drew a cleantable beside them; an upper servant brought them bread and offeredthem many good things of what there was in the house. eteoneuscarved the meat and gave them each their portions, while megapenthespoured out the wine. then they laid their hands upon the good thingsthat were before them, but as soon as they had had had enough to eatand drink telemachus and pisistratus yoked the horses, and tooktheir places in the chariot. they drove out through the innergateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court, andmenelaus came after them with a golden goblet of wine in his righthand that they might make a drink-offering before they set out. hestood in front of the horses and pledged them, saying, "farewell toboth of you; see that you tell nestor how i have treated you, for hewas as kind to me as any father could be while we achaeans werefighting before troy."
"we will be sure, sir," answered telemachus, "to tell him everythingas soon as we see him. i wish i were as certain of finding ulyssesreturned when i get back to ithaca, that i might tell him of thevery great kindness you have shown me and of the many beautifulpresents i am taking with me."
as he was thus speaking a bird flew on his right hand- an eagle witha great white goose in its talons which it had carried off from thefarm yard- and all the men and women were running after it andshouting. it came quite close up to them and flew away on theirright hands in front of the horses. when they saw it they were glad,and their hearts took comfort within them, whereon pisistratus said,"tell me, menelaus, has heaven sent this omen for us or for you?"
menelaus was thinking what would be the most proper answer for himto make, but helen was too quick for him and said, "i will read thismatter as heaven has put it in my heart, and as i doubt not that itwill come to pass. the eagle came from the mountain where it wasbred and has its nest, and in like manner ulysses, after havingtravelled far and suffered much, will return to take his revenge- ifindeed he is not back already and hatching mischief for the suitors."
"may jove so grant it," replied telemachus; "if it should prove tobe so, i will make vows to you as though you were a god, even when iam at home."
as he spoke he lashed his horses and they started off at fullspeed through the town towards the open country. they swayed theyoke upon their necks and travelled the whole day long till the sunset and darkness was over all the land. then they reached pherae,where diocles lived who was son of ortilochus, the son of alpheus.there they passed the night and were treated hospitably. when thechild of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, they again yoked theirhorses and their places in the chariot. they drove out through theinner gateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. thenpisistratus lashed his horses on and they flew forward nothingloath; ere long they came to pylos, and then telemachus said:
"pisistratus, i hope you will promise to do what i am going to askyou. you know our fathers were old friends before us; moreover, we areboth of an age, and this journey has brought us together still moreclosely; do not, therefore, take me past my ship, but leave methere, for if i go to your father's house he will try to keep me inthe warmth of his good will towards me, and i must go home at once."
pisistratus thought how he should do as he was asked, and in the endhe deemed it best to turn his horses towards the ship, and putmenelaus's beautiful presents of gold and raiment in the stern ofthe vessel. then he said, "go on board at once and tell your men to doso also before i can reach home to tell my father. i know howobstinate he is, and am sure he will not let you go; he will come downhere to fetch you, and he will not go back without you. but he will bevery angry."
with this he drove his goodly steeds back to the city of the pyliansand soon reached his home, but telemachus called the men togetherand gave his orders. "now, my men," said he, "get everything inorder on board the ship, and let us set out home."
thus did he speak, and they went on board even as he had said. butas telemachus was thus busied, praying also and sacrificing to minervain the ship's stern, there came to him a man from a distant country, aseer, who was flying from argos because he had killed a man. he wasdescended from melampus, who used to live in pylos, the land of sheep;he was rich and owned a great house, but he was driven into exile bythe great and powerful king neleus. neleus seized his goods and heldthem for a whole year, during which he was a close prisoner in thehouse of king phylacus, and in much distress of mind both on accountof the daughter of neleus and because he was haunted by a great sorrowthat dread erinyes had laid upon him. in the end, however, heescaped with his life, drove the cattle from phylace to pylos, avengedthe wrong that had been done him, and gave the daughter of neleus tohis brother. then he left the country and went to argos, where itwas ordained that he should reign over much people. there hemarried, established himself, and had two famous sons antiphates andmantius. antiphates became father of oicleus, and oicleus ofamphiaraus, who was dearly loved both by jove and by apollo, but hedid not live to old age, for he was killed in thebes by reason of awoman's gifts. his sons were alcmaeon and amphilochus. mantius, theother son of melampus, was father to polypheides and cleitus.aurora, throned in gold, carried off cleitus for his beauty's sake,that he might dwell among the immortals, but apollo made polypheidesthe greatest seer in the whole world now that amphiaraus was dead.he quarrelled with his father and went to live in hyperesia, wherehe remained and prophesied for all men.
his son, theoclymenus, it was who now came up to telemachus as hewas making drink-offerings and praying in his ship. "friend'" said he,"now that i find you sacrificing in this place, i beseech you byyour sacrifices themselves, and by the god to whom you make them, ipray you also by your own head and by those of your followers, tell methe truth and nothing but the truth. who and whence are you? tell mealso of your town and parents."
telemachus said, "i will answer you quite truly. i am from ithaca,and my father is 'ulysses, as surely as that he ever lived. but he hascome to some miserable end. therefore i have taken this ship and gotmy crew together to see if i can hear any news of him, for he has beenaway a long time."
"i too," answered theoclymenus, am an exile, for i have killed a manof my own race. he has many brothers and kinsmen in argos, and theyhave great power among the argives. i am flying to escape death attheir hands, and am thus doomed to be a wanderer on the face of theearth. i am your suppliant; take me, therefore, on board your shipthat they may not kill me, for i know they are in pursuit."
"i will not refuse you," replied telemachus, "if you wish to joinus. come, therefore, and in ithaca we will treat you hospitablyaccording to what we have."
on this he received theoclymenus' spear and laid it down on the deckof the ship. he went on board and sat in the stern, biddingtheoclymenus sit beside him; then the men let go the hawsers.telemachus told them to catch hold of the ropes, and they made allhaste to do so. they set the mast in its socket in the cross plank,raised it and made it fast with the forestays, and they hoistedtheir white sails with sheets of twisted ox hide. minerva sent thema fair wind that blew fresh and strong to take the ship on hercourse as fast as possible. thus then they passed by crouni andchalcis.
presently the sun set and darkness was over all the land. the vesselmade a quick pass sage to pheae and thence on to elis, where theepeans rule. telemachus then headed her for the flying islands,wondering within himself whether he should escape death or should betaken prisoner.
meanwhile ulysses and the swineherd were eating their supper inthe hut, and the men supped with them. as soon as they had had toeat and drink, ulysses began trying to prove the swineherd and seewhether he would continue to treat him kindly, and ask him to stayon at the station or pack him off to the city; so he said:
"eumaeus, and all of you, to-morrow i want to go away and beginbegging about the town, so as to be no more trouble to you or toyour men. give me your advice therefore, and let me have a goodguide to go with me and show me the way. i will go the round of thecity begging as i needs must, to see if any one will give me a drinkand a piece of bread. i should like also to go to the house of ulyssesand bring news of her husband to queen penelope. i could then go aboutamong the suitors and see if out of all their abundance they will giveme a dinner. i should soon make them an excellent servant in all sortsof ways. listen and believe when i tell you that by the blessing ofmercury who gives grace and good name to the works of all men, thereis no one living who would make a more handy servant than i should- toput fresh wood on the fire, chop fuel, carve, cook, pour out wine, anddo all those services that poor men have to do for their betters."
the swineherd was very much disturbed when he heard this. "heavenhelp me," he exclaimed, "what ever can have put such a notion asthat into your head? if you go near the suitors you will be undoneto a certainty, for their pride and insolence reach the veryheavens. they would never think of taking a man like you for aservant. their servants are all young men, well dressed, wearinggood cloaks and shirts, with well looking faces and their hairalways tidy, the tables are kept quite clean and are loaded withbread, meat, and wine. stay where you are, then; you are not inanybody's way; i do not mind your being here, no more do any of theothers, and when telemachus comes home he will give you a shirt andcloak and will send you wherever you want to go."
ulysses answered, "i hope you may be as dear to the gods as youare to me, for having saved me from going about and getting intotrouble; there is nothing worse than being always ways on the tramp;still, when men have once got low down in the world they will gothrough a great deal on behalf of their miserable bellies. sincehowever you press me to stay here and await the return oftelemachus, tell about ulysses' mother, and his father whom he left onthe threshold of old age when he set out for troy. are they stillliving or are they already dead and in the house of hades?"
"i will tell you all about them," replied eumaeus, "laertes is stillliving and prays heaven to let him depart peacefully his own house,for he is terribly distressed about the absence of his son, and alsoabout the death of his wife, which grieved him greatly and aged himmore than anything else did. she came to an unhappy end through sorrowfor her son: may no friend or neighbour who has dealt kindly by mecome to such an end as she did. as long as she was still living,though she was always grieving, i used to like seeing her and askingher how she did, for she brought me up along with her daughterctimene, the youngest of her children; we were boy and girltogether, and she made little difference between us. when, however, weboth grew up, they sent ctimene to same and received a splendiddowry for her. as for me, my mistress gave me a good shirt and cloakwith a pair of sandals for my feet, and sent me off into thecountry, but she was just as fond of me as ever. this is all over now.still it has pleased heaven to prosper my work in the situationwhich i now hold. i have enough to eat and drink, and can findsomething for any respectable stranger who comes here; but there is nogetting a kind word or deed out of my mistress, for the house hasfallen into the hands of wicked people. servants want sometimes to seetheir mistress and have a talk with her; they like to have somethingto eat and drink at the house, and something too to take back withthem into the country. this is what will keep servants in a goodhumour."
ulysses answered, "then you must have been a very little fellow,eumaeus, when you were taken so far away from your home and parents.tell me, and tell me true, was the city in which your father andmother lived sacked and pillaged, or did some enemies carry you offwhen you were alone tending sheep or cattle, ship you off here, andsell you for whatever your master gave them?"
"stranger," replied eumaeus, "as regards your question: sit still,make yourself comfortable, drink your wine, and listen to me. thenights are now at their longest; there is plenty of time both forsleeping and sitting up talking together; you ought not to go to bedtill bed time, too much sleep is as bad as too little; if any one ofthe others wishes to go to bed let him leave us and do so; he can thentake my master's pigs out when he has done breakfast in the morning.we two will sit here eating and drinking in the hut, and telling oneanother stories about our misfortunes; for when a man has sufferedmuch, and been buffeted about in the world, he takes pleasure inrecalling the memory of sorrows that have long gone by. as regardsyour question, then, my tale is as follows:
"you may have heard of an island called syra that lies over aboveortygia, where the land begins to turn round and look in anotherdirection. it is not very thickly peopled, but the soil is good,with much pasture fit for cattle and sheep, and it abounds with wineand wheat. dearth never comes there, nor are the people plagued by anysickness, but when they grow old apollo comes with diana and killsthem with his painless shafts. it contains two communities, and thewhole country is divided between these two. my father ctesius son oformenus, a man comparable to the gods, reigned over both.
"now to this place there came some cunning traders from phoenicia(for the phoenicians are great mariners) in a ship which they hadfreighted with gewgaws of all kinds. there happened to be a phoenicianwoman in my father's house, very tall and comely, and an excellentservant; these scoundrels got hold of her one day when she was washingnear their ship, seduced her, and cajoled her in ways that no womancan resist, no matter how good she may be by nature. the man who hadseduced her asked her who she was and where she came from, and onthis she told him her father's name. 'i come from sidon,' said she,'and am daughter to arybas, a man rolling in wealth. one day as iwas coming into the town from the country some taphian piratesseized me and took me here over the sea, where they sold me to the manwho owns this house, and he gave them their price for me.'
"the man who had seduced her then said, 'would you like to comealong with us to see the house of your parents and your parentsthemselves? they are both alive and are said to be well off.'
"'i will do so gladly,' answered she, 'if you men will first swearme a solemn oath that you will do me no harm by the way.'
"they all swore as she told them, and when they had completedtheir oath the woman said, 'hush; and if any of your men meets me inthe street or at the well, do not let him speak to me, for fear someone should go and tell my master, in which case he would suspectsomething. he would put me in prison, and would have all of youmurdered; keep your own counsel therefore; buy your merchandise asfast as you can, and send me word when you have done loading. i willbring as much gold as i can lay my hands on, and there is somethingelse also that i can do towards paying my fare. i am nurse to theson of the good man of the house, a funny little fellow just able torun about. i will carry him off in your ship, and you will get a greatdeal of money for him if you take him and sell him in foreign parts.'
"on this she went back to the house. the phoenicians stayed awhole year till they had loaded their ship with much preciousmerchandise, and then, when they had got freight enough, they sentto tell the woman. their messenger, a very cunning fellow, came tomy father's house bringing a necklace of gold with amber beadsstrung among it; and while my mother and the servants had it intheir hands admiring it and bargaining about it, he made a signquietly to the woman and then went back to the ship, whereon shetook me by the hand and led me out of the house. in the fore part ofthe house she saw the tables set with the cups of guests who hadbeen feasting with my father, as being in attendance on him; thesewere now all gone to a meeting of the public assembly, so she snatchedup three cups and carried them off in the bosom of her dress, whilei followed her, for i knew no better. the sun was now set, anddarkness was over all the land, so we hurried on as fast as we couldtill we reached the harbour, where the phoenician ship was lying. whenthey had got on board they sailed their ways over the sea, taking uswith them, and jove sent then a fair wind; six days did we sail bothnight and day, but on the seventh day diana struck the woman and shefell heavily down into the ship's hold as though she were a sea gullalighting on the water; so they threw her overboard to the seals andfishes, and i was left all sorrowful and alone. presently the windsand waves took the ship to ithaca, where laertes gave sundry of hischattels for me, and thus it was that ever i came to set eyes uponthis country."
ulysses answered, "eumaeus, i have heard the story of yourmisfortunes with the most lively interest and pity, but jove has givenyou good as well as evil, for in spite of everything you have a goodmaster, who sees that you always have enough to eat and drink; and youlead a good life, whereas i am still going about begging my way fromcity to city."
thus did they converse, and they had only a very little time leftfor sleep, for it was soon daybreak. in the meantime telemachus andhis crew were nearing land, so they loosed the sails, took down themast, and rowed the ship into the harbour. they cast out their mooringstones and made fast the hawsers; they then got out upon the seashore, mixed their wine, and got dinner ready. as soon as they had hadenough to eat and drink telemachus said, "take the ship on to thetown, but leave me here, for i want to look after the herdsmen onone of my farms. in the evening, when i have seen all i want, i willcome down to the city, and to-morrow morning in return for yourtrouble i will give you all a good dinner with meat and wine."
then theoclymenus said, 'and what, my dear young friend, is tobecome of me? to whose house, among all your chief men, am i torepair? or shall i go straight to your own house and to your mother?"
"at any other time," replied telemachus, "i should have bidden yougo to my own house, for you would find no want of hospitality; atthe present moment, however, you would not be comfortable there, for ishall be away, and my mother will not see you; she does not often showherself even to the suitors, but sits at her loom weaving in anupper chamber, out of their way; but i can tell you a man whosehouse you can go to- i mean eurymachus the son of polybus, who is heldin the highest estimation by every one in ithaca. he is much thebest man and the most persistent wooer, of all those who are payingcourt to my mother and trying to take ulysses' place. jove, however,in heaven alone knows whether or no they will come to a bad end beforethe marriage takes place."
as he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand- a hawk,apollo's messenger. it held a dove in its talons, and the feathers, asit tore them off, fell to the ground midway between telemachus and theship. on this theoclymenus called him apart and caught him by thehand. "telemachus," said he, "that bird did not fly on your right handwithout having been sent there by some god. as soon as i saw it i knewit was an omen; it means that you will remain powerful and thatthere will be no house in ithaca more royal than your own."
"i wish it may prove so," answered telemachus. "if it does, i willshow you so much good will and give you so many presents that allwho meet you will congratulate you."
then he said to his friend piraeus, "piraeus, son of clytius, youhave throughout shown yourself the most willing to serve me of allthose who have accompanied me to pylos; i wish you would take thisstranger to your own house and entertain him hospitably till i cancome for him."
and piraeus answered, "telemachus, you may stay away as long asyou please, but i will look after him for you, and he shall find nolack of hospitality."
as he spoke he went on board, and bade the others do so also andloose the hawsers, so they took their places in the ship. buttelemachus bound on his sandals, and took a long and doughty spearwith a head of sharpened bronze from the deck of the ship. then theyloosed the hawsers, thrust the ship off from land, and made on towardsthe city as they had been told to do, while telemachus strode on asfast as he could, till he reached the homestead where his countlessherds of swine were feeding, and where dwelt the excellentswineherd, who was so devoted a servant to his master.
book xvi.
meanwhile ulysses and the swineherd had lit a fire in the hut andwere were getting breakfast ready at daybreak for they had sent themen out with the pigs. when telemachus came up, the dogs did not bark,but fawned upon him, so ulysses, hearing the sound of feet andnoticing that the dogs did not bark, said to eumaeus:
"eumaeus, i hear footsteps; i suppose one of your men or some one ofyour acquaintance is coming here, for the dogs are fawning urn him andnot barking."
the words were hardly out of his mouth before his son stood at thedoor. eumaeus sprang to his feet, and the bowls in which he was mixingwine fell from his hands, as he made towards his master. he kissed hishead and both his beautiful eyes, and wept for joy. a father could notbe more delighted at the return of an only son, the child of his oldage, after ten years' absence in a foreign country and after havinggone through much hardship. he embraced him, kissed him all over asthough he had come back from the dead, and spoke fondly to him saying:
"so you are come, telemachus, light of my eyes that you are. wheni heard you had gone to pylos i made sure i was never going to see youany more. come in, my dear child, and sit down, that i may have a goodlook at you now you are home again; it is not very often you come intothe country to see us herdsmen; you stick pretty close to the towngenerally. i suppose you think it better to keep an eye on what thesuitors are doing."
"so be it, old friend," answered telemachus, "but i am come nowbecause i want to see you, and to learn whether my mother is stillat her old home or whether some one else has married her, so thatthe bed of ulysses is without bedding and covered with cobwebs."
"she is still at the house," replied eumaeus, "grieving and breakingher heart, and doing nothing but weep, both night and daycontinually."
as spoke he took telemachus' spear, whereon he crossed the stonethreshold and came inside. ulysses rose from his seat to give himplace as he entered, but telemachus checked him; "sit down, stranger."said he, "i can easily find another seat, and there is one here whowill lay it for me."
ulysses went back to his own place, and eumaeus strewed some greenbrushwood on the floor and threw a sheepskin on top of it fortelemachus to sit upon. then the swineherd brought them platters ofcold meat, the remains from what they had eaten the day before, and hefilled the bread baskets with bread as fast as he could. he mixed winealso in bowls of ivy-wood, and took his seat facing ulysses. then theylaid their hands on the good things that were before them, and as soonas they had had enough to eat and drink telemachus said to eumaeus,"old friend, where does this stranger come from? how did his crewbring him to ithaca, and who were they?-for assuredly he did notcome here by land"'
to this you answered, o swineherd eumaeus, "my son, i will tellyou the real truth. he says he is a cretan, and that he has been agreat traveller. at this moment he is running away from athesprotian ship, and has refuge at my station, so i will put him intoyour hands. do whatever you like with him, only remember that he isyour suppliant."
"i am very much distressed," said telemachus, "by what you have justtold me. how can i take this stranger into my house? i am as yetyoung, and am not strong enough to hold my own if any man attacksme. my mother cannot make up her mind whether to stay where she is andlook after the house out of respect for public opinion and thememory of her husband, or whether the time is now come for her to takethe best man of those who are wooing her, and the one who will makeher the most advantageous offer; still, as the stranger has come toyour station i will find him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with asword and sandals, and will send him wherever he wants to go. or ifyou like you can keep him here at the station, and i will send himclothes and food that he may be no burden on you and on your men;but i will not have him go near the suitors, for they are veryinsolent, and are sure to ill-treat him in a way that would greatlygrieve me; no matter how valiant a man may be he can do nothingagainst numbers, for they will be too strong for him."
then ulysses said, "sir, it is right that i should say somethingmyself. i am much shocked about what you have said about theinsolent way in which the suitors are behaving in despite of such aman as you are. tell me, do you submit to such treatment tamely, orhas some god set your people against you? may you not complain of yourbrothers- for it is to these that a man may look for support,however great his quarrel may be? i wish i were as young as you areand in my present mind; if i were son to ulysses, or, indeed,ulysses himself, i would rather some one came and cut my head off, buti would go to the house and be the bane of every one of these men.if they were too many for me- i being single-handed- i would ratherdie fighting in my own house than see such disgraceful sights dayafter day, strangers grossly maltreated, and men dragging the womenservants about the house in an unseemly way, wine drawn recklessly,and bread wasted all to no purpose for an end that shall never beaccomplished."
and telemachus answered, "i will tell you truly everything. there isno emnity between me and my people, nor can i complain of brothers, towhom a man may look for support however great his quarrel may be. jovehas made us a race of only sons. laertes was the only son ofarceisius, and ulysses only son of laertes. i am myself the only sonof ulysses who left me behind him when he went away, so that i havenever been of any use to him. hence it comes that my house is in thehands of numberless marauders; for the chiefs from all theneighbouring islands, dulichium, same, zacynthus, as also all theprincipal men of ithaca itself, are eating up my house under thepretext of paying court to my mother, who will neither say point blankthat she will not marry, nor yet bring matters to an end, so theyare making havoc of my estate, and before long will do so withmyself into the bargain. the issue, however, rests with heaven. but doyou, old friend eumaeus, go at once and tell penelope that i am safeand have returned from pylos. tell it to herself alone, and thencome back here without letting any one else know, for there are manywho are plotting mischief against me."
"i understand and heed you," replied eumaeus; "you need instructme no further, only i am going that way say whether i had not betterlet poor laertes know that you are returned. he used to superintendthe work on his farm in spite of his bitter sorrow about ulysses,and he would eat and drink at will along with his servants; but theytell me that from the day on which you set out for pylos he hasneither eaten nor drunk as he ought to do, nor does he look afterhis farm, but sits weeping and wasting the flesh from off his bones."
"more's the pity," answered telemachus, "i am sorry for him, butwe must leave him to himself just now. if people could have everythingtheir own way, the first thing i should choose would be the returnof my father; but go, and give your message; then make haste backagain, and do not turn out of your way to tell laertes. tell my motherto send one of her women secretly with the news at once, and let himhear it from her."
thus did he urge the swineherd; eumaeus, therefore, took hissandals, bound them to his feet, and started for the town. minervawatched him well off the station, and then came up to it in the formof a woman- fair, stately, and wise. she stood against the side of theentry, and revealed herself to ulysses, but telemachus could not seeher, and knew not that she was there, for the gods do not letthemselves be seen by everybody. ulysses saw her, and so did the dogs,for they did not bark, but went scared and whining off to the otherside of the yards. she nodded her head and motioned to ulysses withher eyebrows; whereon he left the hut and stood before her outside themain wall of the yards. then she said to him:
"ulysses, noble son of laertes, it is now time for you to tellyour son: do not keep him in the dark any longer, but lay your plansfor the destruction of the suitors, and then make for the town. i willnot be long in joining you, for i too am eager for the fray."
as she spoke she touched him with her golden wand. first she threw afair clean shirt and cloak about his shoulders; then she made himyounger and of more imposing presence; she gave him back his colour,filled out his cheeks, and let his beard become dark again. then shewent away and ulysses came back inside the hut. his son wasastounded when he saw him, and turned his eyes away for fear hemight be looking upon a god.
"stranger," said he, "how suddenly you have changed from what youwere a moment or two ago. you are dressed differently and yourcolour is not the same. are you some one or other of the gods thatlive in heaven? if so, be propitious to me till i can make you duesacrifice and offerings of wrought gold. have mercy upon me."
and ulysses said, "i am no god, why should you take me for one? i amyour father, on whose account you grieve and suffer so much at thehands of lawless men."
as he spoke he kissed his son, and a tear fell from his cheek onto the ground, for he had restrained all tears till now. buttelemachus could not yet believe that it was his father, and said:
"you are not my father, but some god is flattering me with vainhopes that i may grieve the more hereafter; no mortal man could ofhimself contrive to do as you have been doing, and make yourself oldand young at a moment's notice, unless a god were with him. a secondago you were old and all in rags, and now you are like some god comedown from heaven."
ulysses answered, "telemachus, you ought not to be so immeasurablyastonished at my being really here. there is no other ulysses who willcome hereafter. such as i am, it is i, who after long wandering andmuch hardship have got home in the twentieth year to my own country.what you wonder at is the work of the redoubtable goddess minerva, whodoes with me whatever she will, for she can do what she pleases. atone moment she makes me like a beggar, and the next i am a young manwith good clothes on my back; it is an easy matter for the gods wholive in heaven to make any man look either rich or poor."
as he spoke he sat down, and telemachus threw his arms about hisfather and wept. they were both so much moved that they cried aloudlike eagles or vultures with crooked talons that have been robbed oftheir half fledged young by peasants. thus piteously did they weep,and the sun would have gone down upon their mourning if telemachus hadnot suddenly said, "in what ship, my dear father, did your crewbring you to ithaca? of what nation did they declare themselves to be-for you cannot have come by land?"
"i will tell you the truth, my son," replied ulysses. "it was thephaeacians who brought me here. they are great sailors, and are in thehabit of giving escorts to any one who reaches their coasts. they tookme over the sea while i was fast asleep, and landed me in ithaca,after giving me many presents in bronze, gold, and raiment. thesethings by heaven's mercy are lying concealed in a cave, and i am nowcome here on the suggestion of minerva that we may consult aboutkilling our enemies. first, therefore, give me a list of thesuitors, with their number, that i may learn who, and how many, theyare. i can then turn the matter over in my mind, and see whether wetwo can fight the whole body of them ourselves, or whether we mustfind others to help us."
to this telemachus answered, "father, i have always heard of yourrenown both in the field and in council, but the task you talk of is avery great one: i am awed at the mere thought of it; two men cannotstand against many and brave ones. there are not ten suitors only, nortwice ten, but ten many times over; you shall learn their number atonce. there are fifty-two chosen youths from dulichium, and theyhave six servants; from same there are twenty-four; twenty youngachaeans from zacynthus, and twelve from ithaca itself, all of themwell born. they have with them a servant medon, a bard, and two menwho can carve at table. if we face such numbers as this, you mayhave bitter cause to rue your coming, and your revenge. see whetheryou cannot think of some one who would be willing to come and helpus."
"listen to me," replied ulysses, "and think whether minerva andher father jove may seem sufficient, or whether i am to try and findsome one else as well."
"those whom you have named," answered telemachus, "are a couple ofgood allies, for though they dwell high up among the clouds theyhave power over both gods and men."
"these two," continued ulysses, "will not keep long out of the fray,when the suitors and we join fight in my house. now, therefore, returnhome early to-morrow morning, and go about among the suitors asbefore. later on the swineherd will bring me to the city disguisedas a miserable old beggar. if you see them ill-treating me, steel yourheart against my sufferings; even though they drag me feet foremostout of the house, or throw things at me, look on and do nothing beyondgently trying to make them behave more reasonably; but they will notlisten to you, for the day of their reckoning is at hand.furthermore i say, and lay my saying to your heart, when minerva shallput it in my mind, i will nod my head to you, and on seeing me do thisyou must collect all the armour that is in the house and hide it inthe strong store room. make some excuse when the suitors ask you whyyou are removing it; say that you have taken it to be out of the wayof the smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when ulysseswent away, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. add to thismore particularly that you are afraid jove may set them on toquarrel over their wine, and that they may do each other some harmwhich may disgrace both banquet and wooing, for the sight of armssometimes tempts people to use them. but leave a sword and a spearapiece for yourself and me, and a couple oxhide shields so that we cansnatch them up at any moment; jove and minerva will then soon quietthese people. there is also another matter; if you are indeed my sonand my blood runs in your veins, let no one know that ulysses iswithin the house- neither laertes, nor yet the swineherd, nor any ofthe servants, nor even penelope herself. let you and me exploit thewomen alone, and let us also make trial of some other of the menservants, to see who is on our side and whose hand is against us."
"father," replied telemachus, "you will come to know me by and by,and when you do you will find that i can keep your counsel. i do notthink, however, the plan you propose will turn out well for eitherof us. think it over. it will take us a long time to go the round ofthe farms and exploit the men, and all the time the suitors will bewasting your estate with impunity and without compunction. prove thewomen by all means, to see who are disloyal and who guiltless, but iam not in favour of going round and trying the men. we can attend tothat later on, if you really have some sign from jove that he willsupport you."
thus did they converse, and meanwhile the ship which had broughttelemachus and his crew from pylos had reached the town of ithaca.when they had come inside the harbour they drew the ship on to theland; their servants came and took their armour from them, and theyleft all the presents at the house of clytius. then they sent aservant to tell penelope that telemachus had gone into the country,but had sent the ship to the town to prevent her from being alarmedand made unhappy. this servant and eumaeus happened to meet whenthey were both on the same errand of going to tell penelope. when theyreached the house, the servant stood up and said to the queen in thepresence of the waiting women, "your son, madam, is now returnedfrom pylos"; but eumaeus went close up to penelope, and said privatelythat her son had given bidden him tell her. when he had given hismessage he left the house with its outbuildings and went back to hispigs again.
the suitors were surprised and angry at what had happened, so theywent outside the great wall that ran round the outer court, and held acouncil near the main entrance. eurymachus, son of polybus, was thefirst to speak.
"my friends," said he, "this voyage of telemachus's is a veryserious matter; we had made sure that it would come to nothing. now,however, let us draw a ship into the water, and get a crew together tosend after the others and tell them to come back as fast as they can."
he had hardly done speaking when amphinomus turned in his placeand saw the ship inside the harbour, with the crew lowering her sails,and putting by their oars; so he laughed, and said to the others,"we need not send them any message, for they are here. some god musthave told them, or else they saw the ship go by, and could notovertake her.
on this they rose and went to the water side. the crew then drew theship on shore; their servants took their armour from them, and theywent up in a body to the place of assembly, but they would not let anyone old or young sit along with them, and antinous, son ofeupeithes, spoke first.
"good heavens," said he, "see how the gods have saved this manfrom destruction. we kept a succession of scouts upon the headlandsall day long, and when the sun was down we never went on shore tosleep, but waited in the ship all night till morning in the hope ofcapturing and killing him; but some god has conveyed him home in spiteof us. let us consider how we can make an end of him. he must notescape us; our affair is never likely to come off while is alive,for he is very shrewd, and public feeling is by no means all on ourside. we must make haste before he can call the achaeans inassembly; he will lose no time in doing so, for he will be furiouswith us, and will tell all the world how we plotted to kill him, butfailed to take him. the people will not like this when they come toknow of it; we must see that they do us no hurt, nor drive us from ourown country into exile. let us try and lay hold of him either on hisfarm away from the town, or on the road hither. then we can divideup his property amongst us, and let his mother and the man who marriesher have the house. if this does not please you, and you wishtelemachus to live on and hold his father's property, then we must notgather here and eat up his goods in this way, but must make our offersto penelope each from his own house, and she can marry the man whowill give the most for her, and whose lot it is to win her."
they all held their peace until amphinomus rose to speak. he was theson of nisus, who was son to king aretias, and he was foremost amongall the suitors from the wheat-growing and well grassed island ofdulichium; his conversation, moreover, was more agreeable topenelope than that of any of the other for he was a man of goodnatural disposition. "my friends," said he, speaking to them plainlyand in all honestly, "i am not in favour of killing telemachus. itis a heinous thing to kill one who is of noble blood. let us firsttake counsel of the gods, and if the oracles of jove advise it, i willboth help to kill him myself, and will urge everyone else to do so;but if they dissuade us, i would have you hold your hands."
thus did he speak, and his words pleased them well, so they roseforthwith and went to the house of ulysses where they took theiraccustomed seats.
then penelope resolved that she would show herself to the suitors.she knew of the plot against telemachus, for the servant medon hadoverheard their counsels and had told her; she went down thereforeto the court attended by her maidens, and when she reached the suitorsshe stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of thecloister holding a veil before her face, and rebuked antinous saying:
"antinous, insolent and wicked schemer, they say you are the bestspeaker and counsellor of any man your own age in ithaca, but youare nothing of the kind. madman, why should you try to compass thedeath of telemachus, and take no heed of suppliants, whose witnessis jove himself? it is not right for you to plot thus against oneanother. do you not remember how your father fled to this house infear of the people, who were enraged against him for having gonewith some taphian pirates and plundered the thesprotians who were atpeace with us? they wanted to tear him in pieces and eat up everythinghe had, but ulysses stayed their hands although they wereinfuriated, and now you devour his property without paying for it, andbreak my heart by his wooing his wife and trying to kill his son.leave off doing so, and stop the others also."
to this eurymachus son of polybus answered, "take heart, queenpenelope daughter of icarius, and do not trouble yourself aboutthese matters. the man is not yet born, nor never will be, who shalllay hands upon your son telemachus, while i yet live to look uponthe face of the earth. i say- and it shall surely be- that my spearshall be reddened with his blood; for many a time has ulysses taken meon his knees, held wine up to my lips to drink, and put pieces of meatinto my hands. therefore telemachus is much the dearest friend i have,and has nothing to fear from the hands of us suitors. of course, ifdeath comes to him from the gods, he cannot escape it." he said thisto quiet her, but in reality he was plotting against telemachus.
then penelope went upstairs again and mourned her husband tillminerva shed sleep over her eyes. in the evening eumaeus got back toulysses and his son, who had just sacrificed a young pig of a year oldand were ready; helping one another to get supper ready; minervatherefore came up to ulysses, turned him into an old man with a strokeof her wand, and clad him in his old clothes again, for fear thatthe swineherd might recognize him and not keep the secret, but goand tell penelope.
telemachus was the first to speak. "so you have got back,eumaeus," said he. "what is the news of the town? have the suitorsreturned, or are they still waiting over yonder, to take me on myway home?"
"i did not think of asking about that," replied eumaeus, "when i wasin the town. i thought i would give my message and come back as soonas i could. i met a man sent by those who had gone with you topylos, and he was the first to tell the new your mother, but i can saywhat i saw with my own eyes; i had just got on to the crest of thehill of mercury above the town when i saw a ship coming into harbourwith a number of men in her. they had many shields and spears, and ithought it was the suitors, but i cannot be sure."
on hearing this telemachus smiled to his father, but so that eumaeuscould not see him.
then, when they had finished their work and the meal was ready, theyate it, and every man had his full share so that all were satisfied.as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, they laid down torest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.
book xvii.
when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared,telemachus bound on his sandals and took a strong spear that suitedhis hands, for he wanted to go into the city. "old friend," said he tothe swineherd, "i will now go to the town and show myself to mymother, for she will never leave off grieving till she has seen me. asfor this unfortunate stranger, take him to the town and let him begthere of any one who will give him a drink and a piece of bread. ihave trouble enough of my own, and cannot be burdened with otherpeople. if this makes him angry so much the worse for him, but ilike to say what i mean."
then ulysses said, "sir, i do not want to stay here; a beggar canalways do better in town than country, for any one who likes cangive him something. i am too old to care about remaining here at thebeck and call of a master. therefore let this man do as you havejust told him, and take me to the town as soon as i have had a warm bythe fire, and the day has got a little heat in it. my clothes arewretchedly thin, and this frosty morning i shall be perished withcold, for you say the city is some way off."
on this telemachus strode off through the yards, brooding hisrevenge upon the when he reached home he stood his spear against abearing-post of the cloister, crossed the stone floor of thecloister itself, and went inside.
nurse euryclea saw him long before any one else did. she was puttingthe fleeces on to the seats, and she burst out crying as she ran up tohim; all the other maids came up too, and covered his head andshoulders with their kisses. penelope came out of her room lookinglike diana or venus, and wept as she flung her arms about her son. shekissed his forehead and both his beautiful eyes, "light of my eyes,"she cried as she spoke fondly to him, "so you are come home again; imade sure i was never going to see you any more. to think of yourhaving gone off to pylos without saying anything about it or obtainingmy consent. but come, tell me what you saw."
"do not scold me, mother,' answered telemachus, "nor vex me,seeing what a narrow escape i have had, but wash your face, changeyour dress, go upstairs with your maids, and promise full andsufficient hecatombs to all the gods if jove will only grant us ourrevenge upon the suitors. i must now go to the place of assembly toinvite a stranger who has come back with me from pylos. i sent himon with my crew, and told piraeus to take him home and look afterhim till i could come for him myself."
she heeded her son's words, washed her face, changed her dress,and vowed full and sufficient hecatombs to all the gods if theywould only vouchsafe her revenge upon the suitors.
telemachus went through, and out of, the cloisters spear in hand-not alone, for his two fleet dogs went with him. minerva endowed himwith a presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him ashe went by, and the suitors gathered round him with fair words intheir mouths and malice in their hearts; but he avoided them, and wentto sit with mentor, antiphus, and halitherses, old friends of hisfather's house, and they made him tell them all that had happened tohim. then piraeus came up with theoclymenus, whom he had escortedthrough the town to the place of assembly, whereon telemachus atonce joined them. piraeus was first to speak: "telemachus," said he,"i wish you would send some of your women to my house to take awathe presents menelaus gave you."
"we do not know, piraeus," answered telemachus, "what may happen. ifthe suitors kill me in my own house and divide my property among them,i would rather you had the presents than that any of those peopleshould get hold of them. if on the other hand i manage to kill them, ishall be much obliged if you will kindly bring me my presents."
with these words he took theoclymenus to his own house. when theygot there they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats, went intothe baths, and washed themselves. when the maids had washed andanointed them, and had given them cloaks and shirts, they took theirseats at table. a maid servant then brought them water in abeautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them towash their hands; and she drew a clean table beside them. an upperservant brought them bread and offered them many good things of whatthere was in the house. opposite them sat penelope, reclining on acouch by one of the bearing-posts of the cloister, and spinning.then they laid their hands on the good things that were before them,and as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink penelope said:
"telemachus, i shall go upstairs and lie down on that sad couch,which i have not ceased to water with my tears, from the day ulyssesset out for troy with the sons of atreus. you failed, however, to makeit clear to me before the suitors came back to the house, whether orno you had been able to hear anything about the return of yourfather."
"i will tell you then truth," replied her son. "we went to pylos andsaw nestor, who took me to his house and treated me as hospitably asthough i were a son of his own who had just returned after a longabsence; so also did his sons; but he said he had not heard a wordfrom any human being about ulysses, whether he was alive or dead. hesent me, therefore, with a chariot and horses to menelaus. there i sawhelen, for whose sake so many, both argives and trojans, were inheaven's wisdom doomed to suffer. menelaus asked me what it was thathad brought me to lacedaemon, and i told him the whole truth,whereon he said, 'so, then, these cowards would usurp a brave man'sbed? a hind might as well lay her new-born young in the lair of alion, and then go off to feed in the forest or in some grassy dell.the lion, when he comes back to his lair, will make short work withthe pair of them, and so will ulysses with these suitors. by fatherjove, minerva, and apollo, if ulysses is still the man that he waswhen he wrestled with philomeleides in lesbos, and threw him soheavily that all the greeks cheered him- if he is still such, and wereto come near these suitors, they would have a short shrift and a sorrywedding. as regards your question, however, i will not prevaricate nordeceive you, but what the old man of the sea told me, so much will itell you in full. he said he could see ulysses on an islandsorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph calypso, who waskeeping him prisoner, and he could not reach his home, for he had noships nor sailors to take him over the sea.' this was what menelaustold me, and when i had heard his story i came away; the gods thengave me a fair wind and soon brought me safe home again."
with these words he moved the heart of penelope. then theoclymenussaid to her:
"madam, wife of ulysses, telemachus does not understand thesethings; listen therefore to me, for i can divine them surely, and willhide nothing from you. may jove the king of heaven be my witness,and the rites of hospitality, with that hearth of ulysses to which inow come, that ulysses himself is even now in ithaca, and, eithergoing about the country or staying in one place, is enquiring into allthese evil deeds and preparing a day of reckoning for the suitors. isaw an omen when i was on the ship which meant this, and i toldtelemachus about it."
"may it be even so," answered penelope; "if your words come true,you shall have such gifts and such good will from me that all whosee you shall congratulate you."
thus did they converse. meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs,or aiming with spears at a mark on the levelled ground in front of thehouse, and behaving with all their old insolence. but when it wasnow time for dinner, and the flock of sheep and goats had come intothe town from all the country round, with their shepherds as usual,then medon, who was their favourite servant, and who waited uponthem at table, said, "now then, my young masters, you have hadenough sport, so come inside that we may get dinner ready. dinner isnot a bad thing, at dinner time."
they left their sports as he told them, and when they were withinthe house, they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats inside, andthen sacrificed some sheep, goats, pigs, and a heifer, all of them fatand well grown. thus they made ready for their meal. in the meantimeulysses and the swineherd were about starting for the town, and theswineherd said, "stranger, i suppose you still want to go to townto-day, as my master said you were to do; for my own part i shouldhave liked you to stay here as a station hand, but i must do as mymaster tells me, or he will scold me later on, and a scolding fromone's master is a very serious thing. let us then be off, for it isnow broad day; it will be night again directly and then you willfind it colder."
"i know, and understand you," replied ulysses; "you need say nomore. let us be going, but if you have a stick ready cut, let mehave it to walk with, for you say the road is a very rough one."
as he spoke he threw his shabby old tattered wallet over hisshoulders, by the cord from which it hung, and eumaeus gave him astick to his liking. the two then started, leaving the station incharge of the dogs and herdsmen who remained behind; the swineherd ledthe way and his master followed after, looking like some broken-downold tramp as he leaned upon his staff, and his clothes were all inrags. when they had got over the rough steep ground and were nearingthe city, they reached the fountain from which the citizens drew theirwater. this had been made by ithacus, neritus, and polyctor. there wasa grove of water-loving poplars planted in a circle all round it,and the clear cold water came down to it from a rock high up, whileabove the fountain there was an altar to the nymphs, at which allwayfarers used to sacrifice. here melanthius son of dolius overtookthem as he was driving down some goats, the best in his flock, for thesuitors' dinner, and there were two shepherds with him. when he saweumaeus and ulysses he reviled them with outrageous and unseemlylanguage, which made ulysses very angry.
"there you go," cried he, "and a precious pair you are. see howheaven brings birds of the same feather to one another. where, pray,master swineherd, are you taking this poor miserable object? itwould make any one sick to see such a creature at table. a fellow likethis never won a prize for anything in his life, but will go aboutrubbing his shoulders against every man's door post, and begging,not for swords and cauldrons like a man, but only for a few scraps notworth begging for. if you would give him to me for a hand on mystation, he might do to clean out the folds, or bring a bit of sweetfeed to the kids, and he could fatten his thighs as much as he pleasedon whey; but he has taken to bad ways and will not go about any kindof work; he will do nothing but beg victuals all the town over, tofeed his insatiable belly. i say, therefore and it shall surely be- ifhe goes near ulysses' house he will get his head broken by thestools they will fling at him, till they turn him out."
on this, as he passed, he gave ulysses a kick on the hip out of purewantonness, but ulysses stood firm, and did not budge from the path.for a moment he doubted whether or no to fly at melanthius and killhim with his staff, or fling him to the ground and beat his brainsout; he resolved, however, to endure it and keep himself in check, butthe swineherd looked straight at melanthius and rebuked him, liftingup his hands and praying to heaven as he did so.
"fountain nymphs," he cried, "children of jove, if ever ulyssesburned you thigh bones covered with fat whether of lambs or kids,grant my prayer that heaven may send him home. he would soon put anend to the swaggering threats with which such men as you go aboutinsulting people-gadding all over the town while your flocks are goingto ruin through bad shepherding."
then melanthius the goatherd answered, "you ill-conditioned cur,what are you talking about? some day or other i will put you onboard ship and take you to a foreign country, where i can sell you andpocket the money you will fetch. i wish i were as sure that apollowould strike telemachus dead this very day, or that the suitorswould kill him, as i am that ulysses will never come home again."
with this he left them to come on at their leisure, while he wentquickly forward and soon reached the house of his master. when hegot there he went in and took his seat among the suitors oppositeeurymachus, who liked him better than any of the others. theservants brought him a portion of meat, and an upper woman servant setbread before him that he might eat. presently ulysses and theswineherd came up to the house and stood by it, amid a sound of music,for phemius was just beginning to sing to the suitors. then ulyssestook hold of the swineherd's hand, and said:
"eumaeus, this house of ulysses is a very fine place. no matterhow far you go you will find few like it. one building keeps followingon after another. the outer court has a wall with battlements allround it; the doors are double folding, and of good workmanship; itwould be a hard matter to take it by force of arms. i perceive, too,that there are many people banqueting within it, for there is asmell of roast meat, and i hear a sound of music, which the godshave made to go along with feasting."
then eumaeus said, "you have perceived aright, as indeed yougenerally do; but let us think what will be our best course. willyou go inside first and join the suitors, leaving me here behindyou, or will you wait here and let me go in first? but do not waitlong, or some one may you loitering about outside, and throw somethingat you. consider this matter i pray you."
and ulysses answered, "i understand and heed. go in first andleave me here where i am. i am quite used to being beaten and havingthings thrown at me. i have been so much buffeted about in war andby sea that i am case-hardened, and this too may go with the rest. buta man cannot hide away the cravings of a hungry belly; this is anenemy which gives much trouble to all men; it is because of thisthat ships are fitted out to sail the seas, and to make war upon otherpeople."
as they were thus talking, a dog that had been lying asleep raisedhis head and pricked up his ears. this was argos, whom ulysses hadbred before setting out for troy, but he had never had any work out ofhim. in the old days he used to be taken out by the young men whenthey went hunting wild goats, or deer, or hares, but now that hismaster was gone he was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cowdung that lay in front of the stable doors till the men should comeand draw it away to manure the great close; and he was full offleas. as soon as he saw ulysses standing there, he dropped his earsand wagged his tail, but he could not get close up to his master. whenulysses saw the dog on the other side of the yard, dashed a tearfrom his eyes without eumaeus seeing it, and said:
"eumaeus, what a noble hound that is over yonder on the manure heap:his build is splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks, or is heonly one of those dogs that come begging about a table, and are keptmerely for show?"
"this hound," answered eumaeus, "belonged to him who has died in afar country. if he were what he was when ulysses left for troy, hewould soon show you what he could do. there was not a wild beast inthe forest that could get away from him when he was once on itstracks. but now he has fallen on evil times, for his master is deadand gone, and the women take no care of him. servants never do theirwork when their master's hand is no longer over them, for jove takeshalf the goodness out of a man when he makes a slave of him."
as he spoke he went inside the buildings to the cloister where thesuitors were, but argos died as soon as he had recognized his master.
telemachus saw eumaeus long before any one else did, and beckonedhim to come and sit beside him; so he looked about and saw a seatlying near where the carver sat serving out their portions to thesuitors; he picked it up, brought it to telemachus's table, and satdown opposite him. then the servant brought him his portion, andgave him bread from the bread-basket.
immediately afterwards ulysses came inside, looking like a poormiserable old beggar, leaning on his staff and with his clothes all inrags. he sat down upon the threshold of ash-wood just inside the doorsleading from the outer to the inner court, and against abearing-post of cypress-wood which the carpenter had skillfullyplaned, and had made to join truly with rule and line. telemachus tooka whole loaf from the bread-basket, with as much meat as he could holdin his two hands, and said to eumaeus, "take this to the stranger, andtell him to go the round of the suitors, and beg from them; a beggarmust not be shamefaced."
so eumaeus went up to him and said, "stranger, telemachus sendsyou this, and says you are to go the round of the suitors begging, forbeggars must not be shamefaced."
ulysses answered, "may king jove grant all happiness totelemachus, and fulfil the desire of his heart."
then with both hands he took what telemachus had sent him, andlaid it on the dirty old wallet at his feet. he went on eating itwhile the bard was singing, and had just finished his dinner as heleft off. the suitors applauded the bard, whereon minerva went up toulysses and prompted him to beg pieces of bread from each one of thesuitors, that he might see what kind of people they were, and tell thegood from the bad; but come what might she was not going to save asingle one of them. ulysses, therefore, went on his round, goingfrom left to right, and stretched out his hands to beg as though hewere a real beggar. some of them pitied him, and were curious abouthim, asking one another who he was and where he came from; whereon thegoatherd melanthius said, "suitors of my noble mistress, i can tellyou something about him, for i have seen him before. the swineherdbrought him here, but i know nothing about the man himself, norwhere he comes from."
on this antinous began to abuse the swineherd. "you precious idiot,"he cried, "what have you brought this man to town for? have we nottramps and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat? doyou think it a small thing that such people gather here to wasteyour master's property and must you needs bring this man as well?"
and eumaeus answered, "antinous, your birth is good but your wordsevil. it was no doing of mine that he came here. who is likely toinvite a stranger from a foreign country, unless it be one of thosewho can do public service as a seer, a healer of hurts, a carpenter,or a bard who can charm us with his such men are welcome all the worldover, but no one is likely to ask a beggar who will only worry him.you are always harder on ulysses' servants than any of the othersuitors are, and above all on me, but i do not care so long astelemachus and penelope are alive and here."
but telemachus said, "hush, do not answer him; antinous has thebitterest tongue of all the suitors, and he makes the others worse."
then turning to antinous he said, "antinous, you take as much careof my interests as though i were your son. why should you want tosee this stranger turned out of the house? heaven forbid; take'something and give it him yourself; i do not grudge it; i bid you takeit. never mind my mother, nor any of the other servants in thehouse; but i know you will not do what i say, for you are more fond ofeating things yourself than of giving them to other people."
"what do you mean, telemachus," replied antinous, "by thisswaggering talk? if all the suitors were to give him as much as iwill, he would not come here again for another three months."
as he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feetfrom under the table, and made as though he would throw it at ulysses,but the other suitors all gave him something, and filled his walletwith bread and meat; he was about, therefore, to go back to thethreshold and eat what the suitors had given him, but he first went upto antinous and said:
"sir, give me something; you are not, surely, the poorest manhere; you seem to be a chief, foremost among them all; therefore youshould be the better giver, and i will tell far and wide of yourbounty. i too was a rich man once, and had a fine house of my own;in those days i gave to many a tramp such as i now am, no matter whohe might be nor what he wanted. i had any number of servants, andall the other things which people have who live well and are accountedwealthy, but it pleased jove to take all away from me. he sent me witha band of roving robbers to egypt; it was a long voyage and i wasundone by it. i stationed my bade ships in the river aegyptus, andbade my men stay by them and keep guard over them, while sent outscouts to reconnoitre from every point of vantage.
"but the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, andravaged the land of the egyptians, killing the men, and taking theirwives and children captives. the alarm was soon carried to the city,and when they heard the war-cry, the people came out at daybreaktill the plain was filled with soldiers horse and foot, and with thegleam of armour. then jove spread panic among my men, and they wouldno longer face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. theegyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do forcedlabour for them; as for myself, they gave me to a friend who met them,to take to cyprus, dmetor by name, son of iasus, who was a great manin cyprus. thence i am come hither in a state of great misery."
then antinous said, "what god can have sent such a pestilence toplague us during our dinner? get out, into the open part of the court,or i will give you egypt and cyprus over again for your insolenceand importunity; you have begged of all the others, and they havegiven you lavishly, for they have abundance round them, and it is easyto be free with other people's property when there is plenty of it."
on this ulysses began to move off, and said, "your looks, my finesir, are better than your breeding; if you were in your own houseyou would not spare a poor man so much as a pinch of salt, forthough you are in another man's, and surrounded with abundance, youcannot find it in you to give him even a piece of bread."
this made antinous very angry, and he scowled at him saying, "youshall pay for this before you get clear of the court." with thesewords he threw a footstool at him, and hit him on the rightshoulder-blade near the top of his back. ulysses stood firm as arock and the blow did not even stagger him, but he shook his head insilence as he brooded on his revenge. then he went back to thethreshold and sat down there, laying his well-filled wallet at hisfeet.
"listen to me," he cried, "you suitors of queen penelope, that i mayspeak even as i am minded. a man knows neither ache nor pain if hegets hit while fighting for his money, or for his sheep or his cattle;and even so antinous has hit me while in the service of my miserablebelly, which is always getting people into trouble. still, if the poorhave gods and avenging deities at all, i pray them that antinous maycome to a bad end before his marriage."
"sit where you are, and eat your victuals in silence, or be offelsewhere," shouted antinous. "if you say more i will have you draggedhand and foot through the courts, and the servants shall flay youalive."
the other suitors were much displeased at this, and one of the youngmen said, "antinous, you did ill in striking that poor wretch of atramp: it will be worse for you if he should turn out to be somegod- and we know the gods go about disguised in all sorts of ways aspeople from foreign countries, and travel about the world to see whodo amiss and who righteously."
thus said the suitors, but antinous paid them no heed. meanwhiletelemachus was furious about the blow that had been given to hisfather, and though no tear fell from him, he shook his head in silenceand brooded on his revenge.
now when penelope heard that the beggar had been struck in thebanqueting-cloister, she said before her maids, "would that apollowould so strike you, antinous," and her waiting woman eurynomeanswered, "if our prayers were answered not one of the suitors wouldever again see the sun rise." then penelope said, "nurse, i hate everysingle one of them, for they mean nothing but mischief, but i hateantinous like the darkness of death itself. a poor unfortunate tramphas come begging about the house for sheer want. every one else hasgiven him something to put in his wallet, but antinous has hit himon the right shoulder-blade with a footstool."
thus did she talk with her maids as she sat in her own room, andin the meantime ulysses was getting his dinner. then she called forthe swineherd and said, "eumaeus, go and tell the stranger to comehere, i want to see him and ask him some questions. he seems to havetravelled much, and he may have seen or heard something of myunhappy husband."
to this you answered, o swineherd eumaeus, "if these achaeans,madam, would only keep quiet, you would be charmed with the history ofhis adventures. i had him three days and three nights with me in myhut, which was the first place he reached after running away fromhis ship, and he has not yet completed the story of his misfortunes.if he had been the most heaven-taught minstrel in the whole world,on whose lips all hearers hang entranced, i could not have been morecharmed as i sat in my hut and listened to him. he says there is anold friendship between his house and that of ulysses, and that hecomes from crete where the descendants of minos live, after havingbeen driven hither and thither by every kind of misfortune; he alsodeclares that he has heard of ulysses as being alive and near athand among the thesprotians, and that he is bringing great wealth homewith him."
"call him here, then," said penelope, "that i too may hear hisstory. as for the suitors, let them take their pleasure indoors or outas they will, for they have nothing to fret about. their corn and wineremain unwasted in their houses with none but servants to consumethem, while they keep hanging about our house day after daysacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, andnever giving so much as a thought to the quantity of wine theydrink. no estate can stand such recklessness, for we have now noulysses to protect us. if he were to come again, he and his sonwould soon have their revenge."
as she spoke telemachus sneezed so loudly that the whole houseresounded with it. penelope laughed when she heard this, and said toeumaeus, "go and call the stranger; did you not hear how my sonsneezed just as i was speaking? this can only mean that all thesuitors are going to be killed, and that not one of them shall escape.furthermore i say, and lay my saying to your heart: if i amsatisfied that the stranger is speaking the truth i shall give him ashirt and cloak of good wear."
when eumaeus heard this he went straight to ulysses and said,"father stranger, my mistress penelope, mother of telemachus, has sentfor you; she is in great grief, but she wishes to hear anything youcan tell her about her husband, and if she is satisfied that you arespeaking the truth, she will give you a shirt and cloak, which are thevery things that you are most in want of. as for bread, you can getenough of that to fill your belly, by begging about the town, andletting those give that will."
"i will tell penelope," answered ulysses, "nothing but what isstrictly true. i know all about her husband, and have been partnerwith him in affliction, but i am afraid of passing. through this crowdof cruel suitors, for their pride and insolence reach heaven. justnow, moreover, as i was going about the house without doing anyharm, a man gave me a blow that hurt me very much, but neithertelemachus nor any one else defended me. tell penelope, therefore,to be patient and wait till sundown. let her give me a seat close upto the fire, for my clothes are worn very thin- you know they are, foryou have seen them ever since i first asked you to help me- she canthen ask me about the return of her husband."
the swineherd went back when he heard this, and penelope said as shesaw him cross the threshold, "why do you not bring him here,eumaeus? is he afraid that some one will ill-treat him, or is he shyof coming inside the house at all? beggars should not be shamefaced."
to this you answered, o swineherd eumaeus, "the stranger is quitereasonable. he is avoiding the suitors, and is only doing what any oneelse would do. he asks you to wait till sundown, and it will be muchbetter, madam, that you should have him all to yourself, when youcan hear him and talk to him as you will."
"the man is no fool," answered penelope, "it would very likely be ashe says, for there are no such abominable people in the whole world asthese men are."
when she had done speaking eumaeus went back to the suitors, forhe had explained everything. then he went up to telemachus and said inhis ear so that none could overhear him, "my dear sir, i will now goback to the pigs, to see after your property and my own business.you will look to what is going on here, but above all be careful tokeep out of danger, for there are many who bear you ill will. may jovebring them to a bad end before they do us a mischief."
"very well," replied telemachus, "go home when you have had yourdinner, and in the morning come here with the victims we are tosacrifice for the day. leave the rest to heaven and me."
on this eumaeus took his seat again, and when he had finished hisdinner he left the courts and the cloister with the men at table,and went back to his pigs. as for the suitors, they presently began toamuse themselves with singing and dancing, for it was now getting ontowards evening.
book xviii.
now there came a certain common tramp who used to go begging allover the city of ithaca, and was notorious as an incorrigibleglutton and drunkard. this man had no strength nor stay in him, but hewas a great hulking fellow to look at; his real name, the one hismother gave him, was arnaeus, but the young men of the place calledhim irus, because he used to run errands for any one who would sendhim. as soon as he came he began to insult ulysses, and to try anddrive him out of his own house.
"be off, old man," he cried, "from the doorway, or you shall bedragged out neck and heels. do you not see that they are all giving methe wink, and wanting me to turn you out by force, only i do notlike to do so? get up then, and go of yourself, or we shall come toblows."
ulysses frowned on him and said, "my friend, i do you no manner ofharm; people give you a great deal, but i am not jealous. there isroom enough in this doorway for the pair of us, and you need notgrudge me things that are not yours to give. you seem to be justsuch another tramp as myself, but perhaps the gods will give us betterluck by and by. do not, however, talk too much about fighting or youwill incense me, and old though i am, i shall cover your mouth andchest with blood. i shall have more peace to-morrow if i do, for youwill not come to the house of ulysses any more."
irus was very angry and answered, "you filthy glutton, you run ontrippingly like an old fish-fag. i have a good mind to lay bothhands about you, and knock your teeth out of your head like so manyboar's tusks. get ready, therefore, and let these people here stand byand look on. you will never be able to fight one who is so muchyounger than yourself."
thus roundly did they rate one another on the smooth pavement infront of the doorway, and when antinous saw what was going on helaughed heartily and said to the others, "this is the finest sportthat you ever saw; heaven never yet sent anything like it into thishouse. the stranger and irus have quarreled and are going to fight,let us set them on to do so at once."
the suitors all came up laughing, and gathered round the tworagged tramps. "listen to me," said antinous, "there are some goats'paunches down at the fire, which we have filled with blood and fat,and set aside for supper; he who is victorious and proves himself tobe the better man shall have his pick of the lot; he shall be freeof our table and we will not allow any other beggar about the house atall."
the others all agreed, but ulysses, to throw them off the scent,said, "sirs, an old man like myself, worn out with suffering, cannothold his own against a young one; but my irrepressible belly urgesme on, though i know it can only end in my getting a drubbing. youmust swear, however that none of you will give me a foul blow tofavour irus and secure him the victory."
they swore as he told them, and when they had completed their oathtelemachus put in a word and said, "stranger, if you have a mind tosettle with this fellow, you need not be afraid of any one here.whoever strikes you will have to fight more than one. i am host, andthe other chiefs, antinous and eurymachus, both of them men ofunderstanding, are of the same mind as i am."
every one assented, and ulysses girded his old rags about his loins,thus baring his stalwart thighs, his broad chest and shoulders, andhis mighty arms; but minerva came up to him and made his limbs evenstronger still. the suitors were beyond measure astonished, and onewould turn towards his neighbour saying, "the stranger has broughtsuch a thigh out of his old rags that there will soon be nothingleft of irus."
irus began to be very uneasy as he heard them, but the servantsgirded him by force, and brought him [into the open part of the court]in such a fright that his limbs were all of a tremble. antinousscolded him and said, "you swaggering bully, you ought never to havebeen born at all if you are afraid of such an old broken-down creatureas this tramp is. i say, therefore- and it shall surely be- if hebeats you and proves himself the better man, i shall pack you off onboard ship to the mainland and send you to king echetus, who killsevery one that comes near him. he will cut off your nose and ears, anddraw out your entrails for the dogs to eat."
this frightened irus still more, but they brought him into themiddle of the court, and the two men raised their hands to fight. thenulysses considered whether he should let drive so hard at him as tomake an end of him then and there, or whether he should give him alighter blow that should only knock him down; in the end he deemedit best to give the lighter blow for fear the achaeans should begin tosuspect who he was. then they began to fight, and irus hit ulysseson the right shoulder; but ulysses gave irus a blow on the neckunder the ear that broke in the bones of his skull, and the blood camegushing out of his mouth; he fell groaning in the dust, gnashing histeeth and kicking on the ground, but the suitors threw up theirhands and nearly died of laughter, as ulysses caught hold of him bythe foot and dragged him into the outer court as far as thegate-house. there he propped him up against the wall and put his staffin his hands. "sit here," said he, "and keep the dogs and pigs off;you are a pitiful creature, and if you try to make yourself king ofthe beggars any more you shall fare still worse."
then he threw his dirty old wallet, all tattered and torn, overhis shoulder with the cord by which it hung, and went back to sit downupon the threshold; but the suitors went within the cloisters,laughing and saluting him, "may jove, and all the other gods," saidthey, 'grant you whatever you want for having put an end to theimportunity of this insatiable tramp. we will take him over to themainland presently, to king echetus, who kills every one that comesnear him."
ulysses hailed this as of good omen, and antinous set a great goat'spaunch before him filled with blood and fat. amphinomus took twoloaves out of the bread-basket and brought them to him, pledging himas he did so in a golden goblet of wine. "good luck to you," hesaid, "father stranger, you are very badly off at present, but ihope you will have better times by and by."
to this ulysses answered, "amphinomus, you seem to be a man ofgood understanding, as indeed you may well be, seeing whose son youare. i have heard your father well spoken of; he is nisus ofdulichium, a man both brave and wealthy. they tell me you are his son,and you appear to be a considerable person; listen, therefore, andtake heed to what i am saying. man is the vainest of all creaturesthat have their being upon earth. as long as heaven vouchsafes himhealth and strength, he thinks that he shall come to no harmhereafter, and even when the blessed gods bring sorrow upon him, hebears it as he needs must, and makes the best of it; for godalmighty gives men their daily minds day by day. i know all aboutit, for i was a rich man once, and did much wrong in thestubbornness of my pride, and in the confidence that my father andmy brothers would support me; therefore let a man fear god in allthings always, and take the good that heaven may see fit to send himwithout vainglory. consider the infamy of what these suitors aredoing; see how they are wasting the estate, and doing dishonour to thewife, of one who is certain to return some day, and that, too, notlong hence. nay, he will be here soon; may heaven send you homequietly first that you may not meet with him in the day of his coming,for once he is here the suitors and he will not part bloodlessly."
with these words he made a drink-offering, and when he had drunkhe put the gold cup again into the hands of amphinomus, who walkedaway serious and bowing his head, for he foreboded evil. but even sohe did not escape destruction, for minerva had doomed him fall bythe hand of telemachus. so he took his seat again at the place fromwhich he had come.
then minerva put it into the mind of penelope to show herself to thesuitors, that she might make them still more enamoured of her, and winstill further honour from her son and husband. so she feigned amocking laugh and said, "eurynome, i have changed my and have afancy to show myself to the suitors although i detest them. i shouldlike also to give my son a hint that he had better not have anythingmore to do with them. they speak fairly enough but they meanmischief."
"my dear child," answered eurynome, "all that you have said is true,go and tell your son about it, but first wash yourself and anoint yourface. do not go about with your cheeks all covered with tears; it isnot right that you should grieve so incessantly; for telemachus,whom you always prayed that you might live to see with a beard, isalready grown up."
"i know, eurynome," replied penelope, "that you mean well, but donot try and persuade me to wash and to anoint myself, for heavenrobbed me of all my beauty on the day my husband sailed; nevertheless,tell autonoe and hippodamia that i want them. they must be with mewhen i am in the cloister; i am not going among the men alone; itwould not be proper for me to do so."
on this the old woman went out of the room to bid the maids go totheir mistress. in the meantime minerva bethought her of anothermatter, and sent penelope off into a sweet slumber; so she lay down onher couch and her limbs became heavy with sleep. then the goddess shedgrace and beauty over her that all the achaeans might admire her.she washed her face with the ambrosial loveliness that venus wearswhen she goes dancing with the graces; she made her taller and of amore commanding figure, while as for her complexion it was whiter thansawn ivory. when minerva had done all this she went away, whereonthe maids came in from the women's room and woke penelope with thesound of their talking.
"what an exquisitely delicious sleep i have been having," saidshe, as she passed her hands over her face, "in spite of all mymisery. i wish diana would let me die so sweetly now at this verymoment, that i might no longer waste in despair for the loss of mydear husband, who possessed every kind of good quality and was themost distinguished man among the achaeans."
with these words she came down from her upper room, not alone butattended by two of her maidens, and when she reached the suitors shestood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister,holding a veil before her face, and with a staid maid servant oneither side of her. as they beheld her the suitors were so overpoweredand became so desperately enamoured of her, that each one prayed hemight win her for his own bed fellow.
"telemachus," said she, addressing her son, "i fear you are nolonger so discreet and well conducted as you used to be. when you wereyounger you had a greater sense of propriety; now, however, that youare grown up, though a stranger to look at you would take you forthe son of a well-to-do father as far as size and good looks go,your conduct is by no means what it should be. what is all thisdisturbance that has been going on, and how came you to allow astranger to be so disgracefully ill-treated? what would havehappened if he had suffered serious injury while a suppliant in ourhouse? surely this would have been very discreditable to you."
"i am not surprised, my dear mother, at your displeasure," repliedtelemachus, "i understand all about it and know when things are not asthey should be, which i could not do when i was younger; i cannot,however, behave with perfect propriety at all times. first one andthen another of these wicked people here keeps driving me out of mymind, and i have no one to stand by me. after all, however, this fightbetween irus and the stranger did not turn out as the suitors meant itto do, for the stranger got the best of it. i wish father jove,minerva, and apollo would break the neck of every one of thesewooers of yours, some inside the house and some out; and i wish theymight all be as limp as irus is over yonder in the gate of the outercourt. see how he nods his head like a drunken man; he has had sucha thrashing that he cannot stand on his feet nor get back to his home,wherever that may be, for has no strength left in him."
thus did they converse. eurymachus then came up and said, "queenpenelope, daughter of icarius, if all the achaeans in iasian argoscould see you at this moment, you would have still more suitors inyour house by tomorrow morning, for you are the most admirable womanin the whole world both as regards personal beauty and strength ofunderstanding."
to this penelope replied, "eurymachus, heaven robbed me of all mybeauty whether of face or figure when the argives set sail for troyand my dear husband with them. if he were to return and look aftermy affairs, i should both be more respected and show a better presenceto the world. as it is, i am oppressed with care, and with theafflictions which heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. my husbandforesaw it all, and when he was leaving home he took my right wrist inhis hand- 'wife, 'he said, 'we shall not all of us come safe homefrom troy, for the trojans fight well both with bow and spear. theyare excellent also at fighting from chariots, and nothing decidesthe issue of a fight sooner than this. i know not, therefore,whether heaven will send me back to you, or whether i may not fallover there at troy. in the meantime do you look after things here.take care of my father and mother as at present, and even more soduring my absence, but when you see our son growing a beard, thenmarry whom you will, and leave this your present home. this is what hesaid and now it is all coming true. a night will come when i shallhave to yield myself to a marriage which i detest, for jove hastaken from me all hope of happiness. this further grief, moreover,cuts me to the very heart. you suitors are not wooing me after thecustom of my country. when men are courting a woman who they thinkwill be a good wife to them and who is of noble birth, and when theyare each trying to win her for himself, they usually bring oxen andsheep to feast the friends of the lady, and they make hermagnificent presents, instead of eating up other people's propertywithout paying for it."
this was what she said, and ulysses was glad when he heard hertrying to get presents out of the suitors, and flattering them withfair words which he knew she did not mean.
then antinous said, "queen penelope, daughter of icarius, take asmany presents as you please from any one who will give them to you; itis not well to refuse a present; but we will not go about our businessnor stir from where we are, till you have married the best man amongus whoever he may be."
the others applauded what antinous had said, and each one sent hisservant to bring his present. antinous's man returned with a large andlovely dress most exquisitely embroidered. it had twelve beautifullymade brooch pins of pure gold with which to fasten it. eurymachusimmediately brought her a magnificent chain of gold and amber beadsthat gleamed like sunlight. eurydamas's two men returned with someearrings fashioned into three brilliant pendants which glistenedmost beautifully; while king pisander son of polyctor gave her anecklace of the rarest workmanship, and every one else brought her abeautiful present of some kind.
then the queen went back to her room upstairs, and her maids broughtthe presents after her. meanwhile the suitors took to singing anddancing, and stayed till evening came. they danced and sang till itgrew dark; they then brought in three braziers to give light, andpiled them up with chopped firewood very and dry, and they lit torchesfrom them, which the maids held up turn and turn about. then ulyssessaid:
"maids, servants of ulysses who has so long been absent, go to thequeen inside the house; sit with her and amuse her, or spin, andpick wool. i will hold the light for all these people. they may staytill morning, but shall not beat me, for i can stand a great deal."
the maids looked at one another and laughed, while pretty melanthobegan to gibe at him contemptuously. she was daughter to dolius, buthad been brought up by penelope, who used to give her toys to playwith, and looked after her when she was a child; but in spite of allthis she showed no consideration for the sorrows of her mistress,and used to misconduct herself with eurymachus, with whom she was inlove.
"poor wretch," said she, "are you gone clean out of your mind? goand sleep in some smithy, or place of public gossips, instead ofchattering here. are you not ashamed of opening your mouth before yourbetters- so many of them too? has the wine been getting into yourhead, or do you always babble in this way? you seem to have lostyour wits because you beat the tramp irus; take care that a better manthan he does not come and cudgel you about the head till he pack youbleeding out of the house."
"vixen," replied ulysses, scowling at her, "i will go and telltelemachus what you have been saying, and he will have you torn limbfrom limb."
with these words he scared the women, and they went off into thebody of the house. they trembled all aver, for they thought he woulddo as he said. but ulysses took his stand near the burning braziers,holding up torches and looking at the people- brooding the while onthings that should surely come to pass.
but minerva would not let the suitors for one moment cease theirinsolence, for she wanted ulysses to become even more bitter againstthem; she therefore set eurymachus son of polybus on to gibe at him,which made the others laugh. "listen to me," said he, "you suitorsof queen penelope, that i may speak even as i am minded. it is not fornothing that this man has come to the house of ulysses; i believethe light has not been coming from the torches, but from his own head-for his hair is all gone, every bit of it."
then turning to ulysses he said, "stranger, will you work as aservant, if i send you to the wolds and see that you are well paid?can you build a stone fence, or plant trees? i will have you fed allthe year round, and will find you in shoes and clothing. will yougo, then? not you; for you have got into bad ways, and do not wantto work; you had rather fill your belly by going round the countrybegging."
"eurymachus," answered ulysses, "if you and i were to work oneagainst the other in early summer when the days are at theirlongest- give me a good scythe, and take another yourself, and letus see which will fast the longer or mow the stronger, from dawntill dark when the mowing grass is about. or if you will ploughagainst me, let us each take a yoke of tawny oxen, well-mated and ofgreat strength and endurance: turn me into a four acre field, andsee whether you or i can drive the straighter furrow. if, again, warwere to break out this day, give me a shield, a couple of spears and ahelmet fitting well upon my temples- you would find me foremost in thefray, and would cease your gibes about my belly. you are insolentand cruel, and think yourself a great man because you live in a littleworld, ind that a bad one. if ulysses comes to his own again, thedoors of his house are wide, but you will find them narrow when youtry to fly through them."
eurymachus was furious at all this. he scowled at him and cried,"you wretch, i will soon pay you out for daring to say such thingsto me, and in public too. has the wine been getting into your heador do you always babble in this way? you seem to have lost your witsbecause you beat the tramp irus. with this he caught hold of afootstool, but ulysses sought protection at the knees of amphinomus ofdulichium, for he was afraid. the stool hit the cupbearer on his righthand and knocked him down: the man fell with a cry flat on his back,and his wine-jug fell ringing to the ground. the suitors in thecovered cloister were now in an uproar, and one would turn towards hisneighbour, saying, "i wish the stranger had gone somewhere else, badluck to hide, for all the trouble he gives us. we cannot permit suchdisturbance about a beggar; if such ill counsels are to prevail weshall have no more pleasure at our banquet."
on this telemachus came forward and said, "sirs, are you mad? canyou not carry your meat and your liquor decently? some evil spirit haspossessed you. i do not wish to drive any of you away, but you havehad your suppers, and the sooner you all go home to bed the better."
the suitors bit their lips and marvelled at the boldness of hisspeech; but amphinomus the son of nisus, who was son to aretias, said,"do not let us take offence; it is reasonable, so let us make noanswer. neither let us do violence to the stranger nor to any ofulysses' servants. let the cupbearer go round with thedrink-offerings, that we may make them and go home to our rest. as forthe stranger, let us leave telemachus to deal with him, for it is tohis house that he has come."
thus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well, so mulius ofdulichium, servant to amphinomus, mixed them a bowl of wine andwater and handed it round to each of them man by man, whereon theymade their drink-offerings to the blessed gods: then, when they hadmade their drink-offerings and had drunk each one as he was minded,they took their several ways each of them to his own abode.
book xix.
ulysses was left in the cloister, pondering on the means wherebywith minerva's help he might be able to kill the suitors. presently hesaid to telemachus, "telemachus, we must get the armour together andtake it down inside. make some excuse when the suitors ask you why youhave removed it. say that you have taken it to be out of the way ofthe smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when ulysses wentaway, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. add to this moreparticularly that you are afraid jove may set them on to quarrelover their wine, and that they may do each other some harm which maydisgrace both banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimestempts people to use them."
telemachus approved of what his father had said, so he callednurse euryclea and said, "nurse, shut the women up in their room,while i take the armour that my father left behind him down into thestore room. no one looks after it now my father is gone, and it hasgot all smirched with soot during my own boyhood. i want to take itdown where the smoke cannot reach it."
"i wish, child," answered euryclea, "that you would take themanagement of the house into your own hands altogether, and look afterall the property yourself. but who is to go with you and light youto the store room? the maids would have so, but you would not letthem.
"the stranger," said telemachus, "shall show me a light; when peopleeat my bread they must earn it, no matter where they come from."
euryclea did as she was told, and bolted the women inside theirroom. then ulysses and his son made all haste to take the helmets,shields, and spears inside; and minerva went before them with a goldlamp in her hand that shed a soft and brilliant radiance, whereontelemachus said, "father, my eyes behold a great marvel: the walls,with the rafters, crossbeams, and the supports on which they restare all aglow as with a flaming fire. surely there is some god herewho has come down from heaven."
"hush," answered ulysses, "hold your peace and ask no questions, forthis is the manner of the gods. get you to your bed, and leave me hereto talk with your mother and the maids. your mother in her griefwill ask me all sorts of questions."
on this telemachus went by torch-light to the other side of theinner court, to the room in which he always slept. there he lay in hisbed till morning, while ulysses was left in the cloister ponderingon the means whereby with minerva's help he might be able to killthe suitors.
then penelope came down from her room looking like venus or diana,and they set her a seat inlaid with scrolls of silver and ivory nearthe fire in her accustomed place. it had been made by icmalius and hada footstool all in one piece with the seat itself; and it wascovered with a thick fleece: on this she now sat, and the maids camefrom the women's room to join her. they set about removing thetables at which the wicked suitors had been dining, and took awaythe bread that was left, with the cups from which they had drunk. theyemptied the embers out of the braziers, and heaped much wood upon themto give both light and heat; but melantho began to rail at ulysses asecond time and said, "stranger, do you mean to plague us by hangingabout the house all night and spying upon the women? be off, youwretch, outside, and eat your supper there, or you shall be driven outwith a firebrand."
ulysses scowled at her and answered, "my good woman, why shouldyou be so angry with me? is it because i am not clean, and myclothes are all in rags, and because i am obliged to go beggingabout after the manner of tramps and beggars generall? i too was arich man once, and had a fine house of my own; in those days i gave tomany a tramp such as i now am, no matter who he might be nor what hewanted. i had any number of servants, and all the other things whichpeople have who live well and are accounted wealthy, but it pleasedjove to take all away from me; therefore, woman, beware lest you toocome to lose that pride and place in which you now wanton above yourfellows; have a care lest you get out of favour with your mistress,and lest ulysses should come home, for there is still a chance that hemay do so. moreover, though he be dead as you think he is, yet byapollo's will he has left a son behind him, telemachus, who willnote anything done amiss by the maids in the house, for he is now nolonger in his boyhood."
penelope heard what he was saying and scolded the maid, "impudentbaggage, said she, "i see how abominably you are behaving, and youshall smart for it. you knew perfectly well, for i told you myself,that i was going to see the stranger and ask him about my husband, forwhose sake i am in such continual sorrow."
then she said to her head waiting woman eurynome, "bring a seat witha fleece upon it, for the stranger to sit upon while he tells hisstory, and listens to what i have to say. i wish to ask him somequestions."
eurynome brought the seat at once and set a fleece upon it, and assoon as ulysses had sat down penelope began by saying, "stranger, ishall first ask you who and whence are you? tell me of your town andparents."
"madam;" answered ulysses, "who on the face of the whole earth candare to chide with you? your fame reaches the firmament of heavenitself; you are like some blameless king, who upholds righteousness,as the monarch over a great and valiant nation: the earth yields itswheat and barley, the trees are loaded with fruit, the ewes bringforth lambs, and the sea abounds with fish by reason of his virtues,and his people do good deeds under him. nevertheless, as i sit here inyour house, ask me some other question and do not seek to know my raceand family, or you will recall memories that will yet more increase mysorrow. i am full of heaviness, but i ought not to sit weeping andwailing in another person's house, nor is it well to be thusgrieving continually. i shall have one of the servants or evenyourself complaining of me, and saying that my eyes swim with tearsbecause i am heavy with wine."
then penelope answered, "stranger, heaven robbed me of all beauty,whether of face or figure, when the argives set sail for troy and mydear husband with them. if he were to return and look after my affairsi should be both more respected and should show a better presence tothe world. as it is, i am oppressed with care, and with theafflictions which heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. the chiefs fromall our islands- dulichium, same, and zacynthus, as also from ithacaitself, are wooing me against my will and are wasting my estate. i cantherefore show no attention to strangers, nor suppliants, nor topeople who say that they are skilled artisans, but am all the timebrokenhearted about ulysses. they want me to marry again at once,and i have to invent stratagems in order to deceive them. in the firstplace heaven put it in my mind to set up a great tambour-frame in myroom, and to begin working upon an enormous piece of fineneedlework. then i said to them, 'sweethearts, ulysses is indeed dead,still, do not press me to marry again immediately; wait- for i wouldnot have my skill in needlework perish unrecorded- till i havefinished making a pall for the hero laertes, to be ready against thetime when death shall take him. he is very rich, and the women ofthe place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.' this was what isaid, and they assented; whereon i used to keep working at my greatweb all day long, but at night i would unpick the stitches again bytorch light. i fooled them in this way for three years without theirfinding it out, but as time wore on and i was now in my fourth year,in the waning of moons, and many days had been accomplished, thosegood-for-nothing hussies my maids betrayed me to the suitors, whobroke in upon me and caught me; they were very angry with me, so i wasforced to finish my work whether i would or no. and now i do not seehow i can find any further shift for getting out of this marriage.my parents are putting great pressure upon me, and my son chafes atthe ravages the suitors are making upon his estate, for he is nowold enough to understand all about it and is perfectly able to lookafter his own affairs, for heaven has blessed him with an excellentdisposition. still, notwithstanding all this, tell me who you areand where you come from- for you must have had father and mother ofsome sort; you cannot be the son of an oak or of a rock."
then ulysses answered, "madam, wife of ulysses, since you persist inasking me about my family, i will answer, no matter what it costsme: people must expect to be pained when they have been exiles as longas i have, and suffered as much among as many peoples. nevertheless,as regards your question i will tell you all you ask. there is afair and fruitful island in mid-ocean called crete; it is thicklypeopled and there are nine cities in it: the people speak manydifferent languages which overlap one another, for there are achaeans,brave eteocretans, dorians of three-fold race, and noble pelasgi.there is a great town there, cnossus, where minos reigned who everynine years had a conference with jove himself. minos was father todeucalion, whose son i am, for deucalion had two sons idomeneus andmyself. idomeneus sailed for troy, and i, who am the younger, amcalled aethon; my brother, however, was at once the older and the morevaliant of the two; hence it was in crete that i saw ulysses andshowed him hospitality, for the winds took him there as he was onhis way to troy, carrying him out of his course from cape malea andleaving him in amnisus off the cave of ilithuia, where the harboursare difficult to enter and he could hardly find shelter from the windsthat were then xaging. as soon as he got there he went into the townand asked for idomeneus, claiming to be his old and valued friend, butidomeneus had already set sail for troy some ten or twelve daysearlier, so i took him to my own house and showed him every kind ofhospitality, for i had abundance of everything. moreover, i fed themen who were with him with barley meal from the public store, andgot subscriptions of wine and oxen for them to sacrifice to theirheart's content. they stayed with me twelve days, for there was a galeblowing from the north so strong that one could hardly keep one's feeton land. i suppose some unfriendly god had raised it for them, buton the thirteenth day the wind dropped, and they got away."
many a plausible tale did ulysses further tell her, and penelopewept as she listened, for her heart was melted. as the snow wastesupon the mountain tops when the winds from south east and west havebreathed upon it and thawed it till the rivers run bank full withwater, even so did her cheeks overflow with tears for the husbandwho was all the time sitting by her side. ulysses felt for her and wasfor her, but he kept his eyes as hard as or iron without lettingthem so much as quiver, so cunningly did he restrain his tears.then, when she had relieved herself by weeping, she turned to himagain and said: "now, stranger, i shall put you to the test and seewhether or no you really did entertain my husband and his men, asyou say you did. tell me, then, how he was dressed, what kind of a manhe was to look at, and so also with his companions."
"madam," answered ulysses, "it is such a long time ago that i canhardly say. twenty years are come and gone since he left my home,and went elsewhither; but i will tell you as well as i canrecollect. ulysses wore a mantle of purple wool, double lined, andit was fastened by a gold brooch with two catches for the pin. onthe face of this there was a device that showed a dog holding aspotted fawn between his fore paws, and watching it as it laypanting upon the ground. every one marvelled at the way in which thesethings had been done in gold, the dog looking at the fawn, andstrangling it, while the fawn was struggling convulsively to escape.as for the shirt that he wore next his skin, it was so soft that itfitted him like the skin of an onion, and glistened in the sunlight tothe admiration of all the women who beheld it. furthermore i say,and lay my saying to your heart, that i do not know whether ulysseswore these clothes when he left home, or whether one of his companionshad given them to him while he was on his voyage; or possibly some oneat whose house he was staying made him a present of them, for he was aman of many friends and had few equals among the achaeans. i myselfgave him a sword of bronze and a beautiful purple mantle, doublelined, with a shirt that went down to his feet, and i sent him onboard his ship with every mark of honour. he had a servant with him, alittle older than himself, and i can tell you what he was like; hisshoulders were hunched, he was dark, and he had thick curly hair.his name was eurybates, and ulysses treated him with greaterfamiliarity than he did any of the others, as being the mostlike-minded with himself."
penelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputableproofs that ulysses laid before her; and when she had again foundrelief in tears she said to him, "stranger, i was already disposedto pity you, but henceforth you shall be honoured and made welcomein my house. it was i who gave ulysses the clothes you speak of. itook them out of the store room and folded them up myself, and igave him also the gold brooch to wear as an ornament. alas! i shallnever welcome him home again. it was by an ill fate that he ever setout for that detested city whose very name i cannot bring myselfeven to mention."
then ulysses answered, "madam, wife of ulysses, do not disfigureyourself further by grieving thus bitterly for your loss, though i canhardly blame you for doing so. a woman who has loved her husband andborne him children, would naturally be grieved at losing him, eventhough he were a worse man than ulysses, who they say was like agod. still, cease your tears and listen to what i can tell i will hidenothing from you, and can say with perfect truth that i have latelyheard of ulysses as being alive and on his way home; he is among thethesprotians, and is bringing back much valuable treasure that hehas begged from one and another of them; but his ship and all his crewwere lost as they were leaving the thrinacian island, for jove and thesun-god were angry with him because his men had slaughtered thesun-god's cattle, and they were all drowned to a man. but ulyssesstuck to the keel of the ship and was drifted on to the land of thephaecians, who are near of kin to the immortals, and who treated himas though he had been a god, giving him many presents, and wishingto escort him home safe and sound. in fact ulysses would have beenhere long ago, had he not thought better to go from land to landgathering wealth; for there is no man living who is so wily as heis; there is no one can compare with him. pheidon king of thethesprotians told me all this, and he swore to me- makingdrink-offerings in his house as he did so- that the ship was by thewater side and the crew found who would take ulysses to his owncountry. he sent me off first, for there happened to be athesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island of dulichium,but he showed me all treasure ulysses had got together, and he hadenough lying in the house of king pheidon to keep his family for tengenerations; but the king said ulysses had gone to dodona that hemight learn jove's mind from the high oak tree, and know whether afterso long an absence he should return to ithaca openly or in secret.so you may know he is safe and will be here shortly; he is close athand and cannot remain away from home much longer; nevertheless i willconfirm my words with an oath, and call jove who is the first andmightiest of all gods to witness, as also that hearth of ulysses towhich i have now come, that all i have spoken shall surely come topass. ulysses will return in this self same year; with the end of thismoon and the beginning of the next he will be here."
"may it be even so," answered penelope; "if your words come true youshall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who seeyou shall congratulate you; but i know very well how it will be.ulysses will not return, neither will you get your escort hence, forso surely as that ulysses ever was, there are now no longer any suchmasters in the house as he was, to receive honourable strangers orto further them on their way home. and now, you maids, wash his feetfor him, and make him a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets, that hemay be warm and quiet till morning. then, at day break wash him andanoint him again, that he may sit in the cloister and take his mealswith telemachus. it shall be the worse for any one of these hatefulpeople who is uncivil to him; like it or not, he shall have no more todo in this house. for how, sir, shall you be able to learn whetheror no i am superior to others of my sex both in goodness of heartand understanding, if i let you dine in my cloisters squalid and illclad? men live but for a little season; if they are hard, and dealhardly, people wish them ill so long as they are alive, and speakcontemptuously of them when they are dead, but he that is righteousand deals righteously, the people tell of his praise among alllands, and many shall call him blessed."
ulysses answered, "madam, i have foresworn rugs and blankets fromthe day that i left the snowy ranges of crete to go on shipboard. iwill lie as i have lain on many a sleepless night hitherto. nightafter night have i passed in any rough sleeping place, and waitedfor morning. nor, again, do i like having my feet washed; i shallnot let any of the young hussies about your house touch my feet;but, if you have any old and respectable woman who has gone through asmuch trouble as i have, i will allow her to wash them."
to this penelope said, "my dear sir, of all the guests who everyet came to my house there never was one who spoke in all thingswith such admirable propriety as you do. there happens to be in thehouse a most respectable old woman- the same who received my poor dearhusband in her arms the night he was born, and nursed him ininfancy. she is very feeble now, but she shall wash your feet.""come here," said she, "euryclea, and wash your master's age-mate; isuppose ulysses' hands and feet are very much the same now as his are,for trouble ages all of us dreadfully fast."
on these words the old woman covered her face with her hands; shebegan to weep and made lamentation saying, "my dear child, i cannotthink whatever i am to do with you. i am certain no one was evermore god-fearing than yourself, and yet jove hates you. no one inthe whole world ever burned him more thigh bones, nor gave him finerhecatombs when you prayed you might come to a green old age yourselfand see your son grow up to take after you; yet see how he hasprevented you alone from ever getting back to your own home. i have nodoubt the women in some foreign palace which ulysses has got to aregibing at him as all these sluts here have been gibing you. i do notwonder at your not choosing to let them wash you after the manner inwhich they have insulted you; i will wash your feet myself gladlyenough, as penelope has said that i am to do so; i will wash them bothfor penelope's sake and for your own, for you have raised the mostlively feelings of compassion in my mind; and let me say thismoreover, which pray attend to; we have had all kinds of strangersin distress come here before now, but i make bold to say that no oneever yet came who was so like ulysses in figure, voice, and feet asyou are."
"those who have seen us both," answered ulysses, "have always saidwe were wonderfully like each other, and now you have noticed it too.
then the old woman took the cauldron in which she was going towash his feet, and poured plenty of cold water into it, adding hottill the bath was warm enough. ulysses sat by the fire, but ere longhe turned away from the light, for it occurred to him that when theold woman had hold of his leg she would recognize a certain scar whichit bore, whereon the whole truth would come out. and indeed as soon asshe began washing her master, she at once knew the scar as one thathad been given him by a wild boar when he was hunting on mountparnassus with his excellent grandfather autolycus- who was the mostaccomplished thief and perjurer in the whole world- and with thesons of autolycus. mercury himself had endowed him with this gift, forhe used to burn the thigh bones of goats and kids to him, so he tookpleasure in his companionship. it happened once that autolycus hadgone to ithaca and had found the child of his daughter just born. assoon as he had done supper euryclea set the infant upon his kneesand said, you must find a name for your grandson; you greatly wishedthat you might have one."
'son-in-law and daughter," replied autolycus, "call the childthus: i am highly displeased with a large number of people in oneplace and another, both men and women; so name the child 'ulysses,' orthe child of anger. when he grows up and comes to visit his mother'sfamily on mount parnassus, where my possessions lie, i will make him apresent and will send him on his way rejoicing."
ulysses, therefore, went to parnassus to get the presents fromautolycus, who with his sons shook hands with him and gave himwelcome. his grandmother amphithea threw her arms about him, andkissed his head, and both his beautiful eyes, while autolycusdesired his sons to get dinner ready, and they did as he told them.they brought in a five year old bull, flayed it, made it ready anddivided it into joints; these they then cut carefully up intosmaller pieces and spitted them; they roasted them sufficiently andserved the portions round. thus through the livelong day to thegoing down of the sun they feasted, and every man had his full shareso that all were satisfied; but when the sun set and it came ondark, they went to bed and enjoyed the boon of sleep.
when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, the sons ofautolycus went out with their hounds hunting, and ulysses went too.they climbed the wooded slopes of parnassus and soon reached itsbreezy upland valleys; but as the sun was beginning to beat upon thefields, fresh-risen from the slow still currents of oceanus, they cameto a mountain dell. the dogs were in front searching for the tracks ofthe beast they were chasing, and after them came the sons ofautolycus, among whom was ulysses, close behind the dogs, and he had along spear in his hand. here was the lair of a huge boar among somethick brushwood, so dense that the wind and rain could not get throughit, nor could the sun's rays pierce it, and the ground underneathlay thick with fallen leaves. the boar heard the noise of the men'sfeet, and the hounds baying on every side as the huntsmen came up tohim, so rushed from his lair, raised the bristles on his neck, andstood at bay with fire flashing from his eyes. ulysses was the firstto raise his spear and try to drive it into the brute, but the boarwas too quick for him, and charged him sideways, ripping him above theknee with a gash that tore deep though it did not reach the bone. asfor the boar, ulysses hit him on the right shoulder, and the pointof the spear went right through him, so that he fell groaning in thedust until the life went out of him. the sons of autolycus busiedthemselves with the carcass of the boar, and bound ulysses' wound;then, after saying a spell to stop the bleeding, they went home asfast as they could. but when autolycus and his sons had thoroughlyhealed ulysses, they made him some splendid presents, and sent himback to ithaca with much mutual good will. when he got back, hisfather and mother were rejoiced to see him, and asked him all aboutit, and how he had hurt himself to get the scar; so he told them howthe boar had ripped him when he was out hunting with autolycus and hissons on mount parnassus.
as soon as euryclea had got the scarred limb in her hands and hadwell hold of it, she recognized it and dropped the foot at once. theleg fell into the bath, which rang out and was overturned, so that allthe water was spilt on the ground; euryclea's eyes between her joy andher grief filled with tears, and she could not speak, but she caughtulysses by the beard and said, "my dear child, i am sure you must beulysses himself, only i did not know you till i had actually touchedand handled you."
as she spoke she looked towards penelope, as though wanting totell her that her dear husband was in the house, but penelope wasunable to look in that direction and observe what was going on, forminerva had diverted her attention; so ulysses caught euryclea bythe throat with his right hand and with his left drew her close tohim, and said, "nurse, do you wish to be the ruin of me, you whonursed me at your own breast, now that after twenty years of wanderingi am at last come to my own home again? since it has been borne inupon you by heaven to recognize me, hold your tongue, and do not say aword about it any one else in the house, for if you do i tell you- andit shall surely be- that if heaven grants me to take the lives ofthese suitors, i will not spare you, though you are my own nurse, wheni am killing the other women."
"my child," answered euryclea, "what are you talking about? you knowvery well that nothing can either bend or break me. i will hold mytongue like a stone or a piece of iron; furthermore let me say, andlay my saying to your heart, when heaven has delivered the suitorsinto your hand, i will give you a list of the women in the house whohave been ill-behaved, and of those who are guiltless."
and ulysses answered, "nurse, you ought not to speak in that way;i am well able to form my own opinion about one and all of them;hold your tongue and leave everything to heaven."
as he said this euryclea left the cloister to fetch some more water,for the first had been all spilt; and when she had washed him andanointed him with oil, ulysses drew his seat nearer to the fire towarm himself, and hid the scar under his rags. then penelope begantalking to him and said:
"stranger, i should like to speak with you briefly about anothermatter. it is indeed nearly bed time- for those, at least, who cansleep in spite of sorrow. as for myself, heaven has given me a life ofsuch unmeasurable woe, that even by day when i am attending to myduties and looking after the servants, i am still weeping andlamenting during the whole time; then, when night comes, and we all ofus go to bed, i lie awake thinking, and my heart comes a prey to themost incessant and cruel tortures. as the dun nightingale, daughter ofpandareus, sings in the early spring from her seat in shadiestcovert hid, and with many a plaintive trill pours out the tale howby mishap she killed her own child itylus, son of king zethus, even sodoes my mind toss and turn in its uncertainty whether i ought tostay with my son here, and safeguard my substance, my bondsmen, andthe greatness of my house, out of regard to public opinion and thememory of my late husband, or whether it is not now time for me togo with the best of these suitors who are wooing me and making me suchmagnificent presents. as long as my son was still young, and unable tounderstand, he would not hear of my leaving my husband's house, butnow that he is full grown he begs and prays me to do so, beingincensed at the way in which the suitors are eating up his property.listen, then, to a dream that i have had and interpret it for me ifyou can. i have twenty geese about the house that eat mash out of atrough, and of which i am exceedingly fond. i dreamed that a greateagle came swooping down from a mountain, and dug his curved beak intothe neck of each of them till he had killed them all. presently hesoared off into the sky, and left them lying dead about the yard;whereon i wept in my room till all my maids gathered round me, sopiteously was i grieving because the eagle had killed my geese. thenhe came back again, and perching on a projecting rafter spoke to mewith human voice, and told me to leave off crying. 'be of goodcourage,' he said, 'daughter of icarius; this is no dream, but avision of good omen that shall surely come to pass. the geese arethe suitors, and i am no longer an eagle, but your own husband, who amcome back to you, and who will bring these suitors to a disgracefulend.' on this i woke, and when i looked out i saw my geese at thetrough eating their mash as usual."
"this dream, madam," replied ulysses, "can admit but of oneinterpretation, for had not ulysses himself told you how it shall befulfilled? the death of the suitors is portended, and not one singleone of them will escape."
and penelope answered, "stranger, dreams are very curious andunaccountable things, and they do not by any means invariably cometrue. there are two gates through which these unsubstantial fanciesproceed; the one is of horn, and the other ivory. those that comethrough the gate of ivory are fatuous, but those from the gate of hornmean something to those that see them. i do not think, however, thatmy own dream came through the gate of horn, though i and my son shouldbe most thankful if it proves to have done so. furthermore i say-and lay my saying to your heart- the coming dawn will usher in theill-omened day that is to sever me from the house of ulysses, for i amabout to hold a tournament of axes. my husband used to set up twelveaxes in the court, one in front of the other, like the stays uponwhich a ship is built; he would then go back from them and shoot anarrow through the whole twelve. i shall make the suitors try to do thesame thing, and whichever of them can string the bow most easily,and send his arrow through all the twelve axes, him will i follow, andquit this house of my lawful husband, so goodly and so abounding inwealth. but even so, i doubt not that i shall remember it in mydreams."
then ulysses answered, "madam wife of ulysses, you need not deferyour tournament, for ulysses will return ere ever they can stringthe bow, handle it how they will, and send their arrows through theiron."
to this penelope said, "as long, sir, as you will sit here andtalk to me, i can have no desire to go to bed. still, people cannot dopermanently without sleep, and heaven has appointed us dwellers onearth a time for all things. i will therefore go upstairs andrecline upon that couch which i have never ceased to flood with mytears from the day ulysses set out for the city with a hateful name."
she then went upstairs to her own room, not alone, but attended byher maidens, and when there, she lamented her dear husband tillminerva shed sweet sleep over her eyelids.
book xx.
ulysses slept in the cloister upon an undressed bullock's hide, onthe top of which he threw several skins of the sheep the suitors hadeaten, and eurynome threw a cloak over him after he had laid himselfdown. there, then, ulysses lay wakefully brooding upon the way inwhich he should kill the suitors; and by and by, the women who hadbeen in the habit of misconducting themselves with them, left thehouse giggling and laughing with one another. this made ulysses veryangry, and he doubted whether to get up and kill every single one ofthem then and there, or to let them sleep one more and last timewith the suitors. his heart growled within him, and as a bitch withpuppies growls and shows her teeth when she sees a stranger, so didhis heart growl with anger at the evil deeds that were being done: buthe beat his breast and said, "heart, be still, you had worse than thisto bear on the day when the terrible cyclops ate your bravecompanions; yet you bore it in silence till your cunning got yousafe out of the cave, though you made sure of being killed."
thus he chided with his heart, and checked it into endurance, but hetossed about as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat infront of a hot fire, doing it first on one side and then on the other,that he may get it cooked as soon as possible, even so did he turnhimself about from side to side, thinking all the time how, singlehanded as he was, he should contrive to kill so large a body of men asthe wicked suitors. but by and by minerva came down from heaven in thelikeness of a woman, and hovered over his head saying, "my poorunhappy man, why do you lie awake in this way? this is your house:your wife is safe inside it, and so is your son who is just such ayoung man as any father may be proud of."
"goddess," answered ulysses, "all that you have said is true, buti am in some doubt as to how i shall be able to kill these wickedsuitors single handed, seeing what a number of them there alwaysare. and there is this further difficulty, which is still moreconsiderable. supposing that with jove's and your assistance i succeedin killing them, i must ask you to consider where i am to escape tofrom their avengers when it is all over."
"for shame," replied minerva, "why, any one else would trust a worseally than myself, even though that ally were only a mortal and lesswise than i am. am i not a goddess, and have i not protected youthroughout in all your troubles? i tell you plainly that even thoughthere were fifty bands of men surrounding us and eager to kill us, youshould take all their sheep and cattle, and drive them away withyou. but go to sleep; it is a very bad thing to lie awake all night,and you shall be out of your troubles before long."
as she spoke she shed sleep over his eyes, and then went back toolympus.
while ulysses was thus yielding himself to a very deep slumberthat eased the burden of his sorrows, his admirable wife awoke, andsitting up in her bed began to cry. when she had relieved herself byweeping she prayed to diana saying, "great goddess diana, daughterof jove, drive an arrow into my heart and slay me; or let somewhirlwind snatch me up and bear me through paths of darkness till itdrop me into the mouths of overflowing oceanus, as it did thedaughters of pandareus. the daughters of pandareus lost their fatherand mother, for the gods killed them, so they were left orphans. butvenus took care of them, and fed them on cheese, honey, and sweetwine. juno taught them to excel all women in beauty of form andunderstanding; diana gave them an imposing presence, and minervaendowed them with every kind of accomplishment; but one day when venushad gone up to olympus to see jove about getting them married (forwell does he know both what shall happen and what not happen toevery one) the storm winds came and spirited them away to becomehandmaids to the dread erinyes. even so i wish that the gods wholive in heaven would hide me from mortal sight, or that fair dianamight strike me, for i would fain go even beneath the sad earth if imight do so still looking towards ulysses only, and without havingto yield myself to a worse man than he was. besides, no matter howmuch people may grieve by day, they can put up with it so long as theycan sleep at night, for when the eyes are closed in slumber peopleforget good and ill alike; whereas my misery haunts me even in mydreams. this very night methought there was one lying by my side whowas like ulysses as he was when he went away with his host, and irejoiced, for i believed that it was no dream, but the very truthitself."
on this the day broke, but ulysses heard the sound of her weeping,and it puzzled him, for it seemed as though she already knew him andwas by his side. then he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces onwhich he had lain, and set them on a seat in the cloister, but he tookthe bullock's hide out into the open. he lifted up his hands toheaven, and prayed, saying "father jove, since you have seen fit tobring me over land and sea to my own home after all the afflictionsyou have laid upon me, give me a sign out of the mouth of some oneor other of those who are now waking within the house, and let me haveanother sign of some kind from outside."
thus did he pray. jove heard his prayer and forthwith thundered highup among the from the splendour of olympus, and ulysses was gladwhen he heard it. at the same time within the house, a miller-womanfrom hard by in the mill room lifted up her voice and gave him anothersign. there were twelve miller-women whose business it was to grindwheat and barley which are the staff of life. the others had groundtheir task and had gone to take their rest, but this one had not yetfinished, for she was not so strong as they were, and when she heardthe thunder she stopped grinding and gave the sign to her master."father jove," said she, "you who rule over heaven and earth, you havethundered from a clear sky without so much as a cloud in it, andthis means something for somebody; grant the prayer, then, of meyour poor servant who calls upon you, and let this be the very lastday that the suitors dine in the house of ulysses. they have worn meout with the labour of grinding meal for them, and i hope they maynever have another dinner anywhere at all."
ulysses was glad when he heard the omens conveyed to him by thewoman's speech, and by the thunder, for he knew they meant that heshould avenge himself on the suitors.
then the other maids in the house rose and lit the fire on thehearth; telemachus also rose and put on his clothes. he girded hissword about his shoulder, bound his sandals on his comely feet, andtook a doughty spear with a point of sharpened bronze; then he went tothe threshold of the cloister and said to euryclea, "nurse, did youmake the stranger comfortable both as regards bed and board, or didyou let him shift for himself?- for my mother, good woman though sheis, has a way of paying great attention to second-rate people, andof neglecting others who are in reality much better men."
"do not find fault child," said euryclea, "when there is no one tofind fault with. the stranger sat and drank his wine as long as heliked: your mother did ask him if he would take any more bread andhe said he would not. when he wanted to go to bed she told theservants to make one for him, but he said he was re such wretchedoutcast that he would not sleep on a bed and under blankets; heinsisted on having an undressed bullock's hide and some sheepskins putfor him in the cloister and i threw a cloak over him myself."
then telemachus went out of the court to the place where theachaeans were meeting in assembly; he had his spear in his hand, andhe was not alone, for his two dogs went with him. but eurycleacalled the maids and said, "come, wake up; set about sweeping thecloisters and sprinkling them with water to lay the dust; put thecovers on the seats; wipe down the tables, some of you, with a wetsponge; clean out the mixing-jugs and the cups, and for water from thefountain at once; the suitors will be here directly; they will be hereearly, for it is a feast day."
thus did she speak, and they did even as she had said: twenty ofthem went to the fountain for water, and the others set themselvesbusily to work about the house. the men who were in attendance onthe suitors also came up and began chopping firewood. by and by thewomen returned from the fountain, and the swineherd came after themwith the three best pigs he could pick out. these he let feed aboutthe premises, and then he said good-humouredly to ulysses,"stranger, are the suitors treating you any better now, or are they asinsolent as ever?"
"may heaven," answered ulysses, "requite to them the wickedness withwhich they deal high-handedly in another man's house without any senseof shame."
thus did they converse; meanwhile melanthius the goatherd came up,for he too was bringing in his best goats for the suitors' dinner; andhe had two shepherds with him. they tied the goats up under thegatehouse, and then melanthius began gibing at ulysses. "are you stillhere, stranger," said he, "to pester people by begging about thehouse? why can you not go elsewhere? you and i shall not come to anunderstanding before we have given each other a taste of our fists.you beg without any sense of decency: are there not feasts elsewhereamong the achaeans, as well as here?"
ulysses made no answer, but bowed his head and brooded. then a thirdman, philoetius, joined them, who was bringing in a barren heiferand some goats. these were brought over by the boatmen who are thereto take people over when any one comes to them. so philoetius made hisheifer and his goats secure under the gatehouse, and then went up tothe swineherd. "who, swineherd," said he, "is this stranger that islately come here? is he one of your men? what is his family? wheredoes he come from? poor fellow, he looks as if he had been somegreat man, but the gods give sorrow to whom they will- even to kingsif it so pleases them
as he spoke he went up to ulysses and saluted him with his righthand; "good day to you, father stranger," said he, "you seem to bevery poorly off now, but i hope you will have better times by andby. father jove, of all gods you are the most malicious. we are yourown children, yet you show us no mercy in all our misery andafflictions. a sweat came over me when i saw this man, and my eyesfilled with tears, for he reminds me of ulysses, who i fear is goingabout in just such rags as this man's are, if indeed he is still amongthe living. if he is already dead and in the house of hades, then,alas! for my good master, who made me his stockman when i was quiteyoung among the cephallenians, and now his cattle are countless; noone could have done better with them than i have, for they have bredlike ears of corn; nevertheless i have to keep bringing them in forothers to eat, who take no heed of his son though he is in thehouse, and fear not the wrath of heaven, but are already eager todivide ulysses' property among them because he has been away solong. i have often thought- only it would not be right while his sonis living- of going off with the cattle to some foreign country; badas this would be, it is still harder to stay here and be ill-treatedabout other people's herds. my position is intolerable, and i shouldlong since have run away and put myself under the protection of someother chief, only that i believe my poor master will yet return, andsend all these suitors flying out of the house."
"stockman," answered ulysses, "you seem to be a very well-disposedperson, and i can see that you are a man of sense. therefore i willtell you, and will confirm my words with an oath: by jove, the chiefof all gods, and by that hearth of ulysses to which i am now come,ulysses shall return before you leave this place, and if you are sominded you shall see him killing the suitors who are now mastershere."
"if jove were to bring this to pass," replied the stockman, "youshould see how i would do my very utmost to help him."
and in like manner eumaeus prayed that ulysses might return home.
thus did they converse. meanwhile the suitors were hatching a plotto murder telemachus: but a bird flew near them on their left hand- aneagle with a dove in its talons. on this amphinomus said, "my friends,this plot of ours to murder telemachus will not succeed; let us goto dinner instead."
the others assented, so they went inside and laid their cloaks onthe benches and seats. they sacrificed the sheep, goats, pigs, and theheifer, and when the inward meats were cooked they served themround. they mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls, and the swineherd gaveevery man his cup, while philoetius handed round the bread in thebreadbaskets, and melanthius poured them out their wine. then theylaid their hands upon the good things that were before them.
telemachus purposely made ulysses sit in the part of the cloisterthat was paved with stone; he gave him a shabby-looking seat at alittle table to himself, and had his portion of the inward meatsbrought to him, with his wine in a gold cup. "sit there," said he,"and drink your wine among the great people. i will put a stop tothe gibes and blows of the suitors, for this is no public house, butbelongs to ulysses, and has passed from him to me. therefore, suitors,keep your hands and your tongues to yourselves, or there will bemischief."
the suitors bit their lips, and marvelled at the boldness of hisspeech; then antinous said, "we do not like such language but wewill put up with it, for telemachus is threatening us in good earnest.if jove had let us we should have put a stop to his brave talk erenow."
thus spoke antinous, but telemachus heeded him not. meanwhile theheralds were bringing the holy hecatomb through the city, and theachaeans gathered under the shady grove of apollo.
then they roasted the outer meat, drew it off the spits, gaveevery man his portion, and feasted to their hearts' content; those whowaited at table gave ulysses exactly the same portion as the othershad, for telemachus had told them to do so.
but minerva would not let the suitors for one moment drop theirinsolence, for she wanted ulysses to become still more bitteragainst them. now there happened to be among them a ribald fellow,whose name was ctesippus, and who came from same. this man,confident in his great wealth, was paying court to the wife ofulysses, and said to the suitors, "hear what i have to say. thestranger has already had as large a portion as any one else; this iswell, for it is not right nor reasonable to ill-treat any guest oftelemachus who comes here. i will, however, make him a present on myown account, that he may have something to give to the bath-woman,or to some other of ulysses' servants."
as he spoke he picked up a heifer's foot from the meat-basket inwhich it lay, and threw it at ulysses, but ulysses turned his head alittle aside, and avoided it, smiling grimly sardinian fashion as hedid so, and it hit the wall, not him. on this telemachus spokefiercely to ctesippus, "it is a good thing for you," said he, "thatthe stranger turned his head so that you missed him. if you had hithim i should have run you through with my spear, and your father wouldhave had to see about getting you buried rather than married in thishouse. so let me have no more unseemly behaviour from any of you,for i am grown up now to the knowledge of good and evil and understandwhat is going on, instead of being the child that i have beenheretofore. i have long seen you killing my sheep and making free withmy corn and wine: i have put up with this, for one man is no match formany, but do me no further violence. still, if you wish to kill me,kill me; i would far rather die than see such disgraceful scenes dayafter day- guests insulted, and men dragging the women servantsabout the house in an unseemly way."
they all held their peace till at last agelaus son of damastor said,"no one should take offence at what has just been said, nor gainsayit, for it is quite reasonable. leave off, therefore, ill-treating thestranger, or any one else of the servants who are about the house; iwould say, however, a friendly word to telemachus and his mother,which i trust may commend itself to both. 'as long,' i would say,'as you had ground for hoping that ulysses would one day come home, noone could complain of your waiting and suffering the suitors to bein your house. it would have been better that he should have returned,but it is now sufficiently clear that he will never do so; thereforetalk all this quietly over with your mother, and tell her to marry thebest man, and the one who makes her the most advantageous offer.thus you will yourself be able to manage your own inheritance, andto eat and drink in peace, while your mother will look after someother man's house, not yours."'
to this telemachus answered, "by jove, agelaus, and by the sorrowsof my unhappy father, who has either perished far from ithaca, or iswandering in some distant land, i throw no obstacles in the way ofmy mother's marriage; on the contrary i urge her to choosewhomsoever she will, and i will give her numberless gifts into thebargain, but i dare not insist point blank that she shall leave thehouse against her own wishes. heaven forbid that i should do this."
minerva now made the suitors fall to laughing immoderately, andset their wits wandering; but they were laughing with a forcedlaughter. their meat became smeared with blood; their eyes filled withtears, and their hearts were heavy with forebodings. theoclymenussaw this and said, "unhappy men, what is it that ails you? there isa shroud of darkness drawn over you from head to foot, your cheeks arewet with tears; the air is alive with wailing voices; the walls androof-beams drip blood; the gate of the cloisters and the courtbeyond them are full of ghosts trooping down into the night of hell;the sun is blotted out of heaven, and a blighting gloom is over allthe land."
thus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily. eurymachusthen said, "this stranger who has lately come here has lost hissenses. servants, turn him out into the streets, since he finds itso dark here."
but theoclymenus said, "eurymachus, you need not send any one withme. i have eyes, ears, and a pair of feet of my own, to say nothing ofan understanding mind. i will take these out of the house with me, fori see mischief overhanging you, from which not one of you men whoare insulting people and plotting ill deeds in the house of ulysseswill be able to escape."
he left the house as he spoke, and went back to piraeus who gave himwelcome, but the suitors kept looking at one another and provokingtelemachus fly laughing at the strangers. one insolent fellow saidto him, "telemachus, you are not happy in your guests; first youhave this importunate tramp, who comes begging bread and wine andhas no skill for work or for hard fighting, but is perfectlyuseless, and now here is another fellow who is setting himself up as aprophet. let me persuade you, for it will be much better, to putthem on board ship and send them off to the sicels to sell for whatthey will bring."
telemachus gave him no heed, but sat silently watching his father,expecting every moment that he would begin his attack upon thesuitors.
meanwhile the daughter of icarius, wise penelope, had had had a richseat placed for her facing the court and cloisters, so that shecould hear what every one was saying. the dinner indeed had beenprepared amid merriment; it had been both good and abundant, forthey had sacrificed many victims; but the supper was yet to come,and nothing can be conceived more gruesome than the meal which agoddess and a brave man were soon to lay before them- for they hadbrought their doom upon themselves.
book xxi.
minerva now put it in penelope's mind to make the suitors trytheir skill with the bow and with the iron axes, in contest amongthemselves, as a means of bringing about their destruction. she wentupstairs and got the store room key, which was made of bronze andhad a handle of ivory; she then went with her maidens into the storeroom at the end of the house, where her husband's treasures of gold,bronze, and wrought iron were kept, and where was also his bow, andthe quiver full of deadly arrows that had been given him by a friendwhom he had met in lacedaemon- iphitus the son of eurytus. the twofell in with one another in messene at the house of ortilochus,where ulysses was staying in order to recover a debt that was owingfrom the whole people; for the messenians had carried off threehundred sheep from ithaca, and had sailed away with them and withtheir shepherds. in quest of these ulysses took a long journey whilestill quite young, for his father and the other chieftains sent him ona mission to recover them. iphitus had gone there also to try andget back twelve brood mares that he had lost, and the mule foalsthat were running with them. these mares were the death of him inthe end, for when he went to the house of jove's son, mighty hercules,who performed such prodigies of valour, hercules to his shame killedhim, though he was his guest, for he feared not heaven's vengeance,nor yet respected his own table which he had set before iphitus, butkilled him in spite of everything, and kept the mares himself. itwas when claiming these that iphitus met ulysses, and gave him the bowwhich mighty eurytus had been used to carry, and which on his deathhad been left by him to his son. ulysses gave him in return a swordand a spear, and this was the beginning of a fast friendship, althoughthey never visited at one another's houses, for jove's son herculeskilled iphitus ere they could do so. this bow, then, given him byiphitus, had not been taken with him by ulysses when he sailed fortroy; he had used it so long as he had been at home, but had left itbehind as having been a keepsake from a valued friend.
penelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store room;the carpenter had planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it so asto get it quite straight; he had then set the door posts into it andhung the doors. she loosed the strap from the handle of the door,put in the key, and drove it straight home to shoot back the boltsthat held the doors; these flew open with a noise like a bullbellowing in a meadow, and penelope stepped upon the raisedplatform, where the chests stood in which the fair linen and clotheswere laid by along with fragrant herbs: reaching thence, she took downthe bow with its bow case from the peg on which it hung. she satdown with it on her knees, weeping bitterly as she took the bow out ofits case, and when her tears had relieved her, she went to thecloister where the suitors were, carrying the bow and the quiver, withthe many deadly arrows that were inside it. along with her came hermaidens, bearing a chest that contained much iron and bronze which herhusband had won as prizes. when she reached the suitors, she stoodby one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister,holding a veil before her face, and with a maid on either side of her.then she said:
"listen to me you suitors, who persist in abusing the hospitality ofthis house because its owner has been long absent, and without otherpretext than that you want to marry me; this, then, being the prizethat you are contending for, i will bring out the mighty bow ofulysses, and whomsoever of you shall string it most easily and sendhis arrow through each one of twelve axes, him will i follow andquit this house of my lawful husband, so goodly, and so abounding inwealth. but even so i doubt not that i shall remember it in mydreams."
as she spoke, she told eumaeus to set the bow and the pieces of ironbefore the suitors, and eumaeus wept as he took them to do as shehad bidden him. hard by, the stockman wept also when he saw hismaster's bow, but antinous scolded them. "you country louts," said he,"silly simpletons; why should you add to the sorrows of yourmistress by crying in this way? she has enough to grieve her in theloss of her husband; sit still, therefore, and eat your dinners insilence, or go outside if you want to cry, and leave the bow behindyou. we suitors shall have to contend for it with might and main,for we shall find it no light matter to string such a bow as thisis. there is not a man of us all who is such another as ulysses; for ihave seen him and remember him, though i was then only a child."
this was what he said, but all the time he was expecting to beable to string the bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in facthe was to be the first that should taste of the arrows from thehands of ulysses, whom he was dishonouring in his own house- eggingthe others on to do so also.
then telemachus spoke. "great heavens!" he exclaimed, "jove musthave robbed me of my senses. here is my dear and excellent mothersaying she will quit this house and marry again, yet i am laughing andenjoying myself as though there were nothing happening. but,suitors, as the contest has been agreed upon, let it go forward. it isfor a woman whose peer is not to be found in pylos, argos, ormycene, nor yet in ithaca nor on the mainland. you know this as wellas i do; what need have i to speak in praise of my mother? come on,then, make no excuses for delay, but let us see whether you can stringthe bow or no. i too will make trial of it, for if i can string it andshoot through the iron, i shall not suffer my mother to quit thishouse with a stranger, not if i can win the prizes which my father wonbefore me."
as he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak fromhim, and took his sword from his shoulder. first he set the axes ina row, in a long groove which he had dug for them, and had wadestraight by line. then he stamped the earth tight round them, andeveryone was surprised when they saw him set up so orderly, thoughhe had never seen anything of the kind before. this done, he went onto the pavement to make trial of the bow; thrice did he tug at it,trying with all his might to draw the string, and thrice he had toleave off, though he had hoped to string the bow and shoot through theiron. he was trying for the fourth time, and would have strung ithad not ulysses made a sign to check him in spite of all hiseagerness. so he said:
"alas! i shall either be always feeble and of no prowess, or i amtoo young, and have not yet reached my full strength so as to beable to hold my own if any one attacks me. you others, therefore,who are stronger than i, make trial of the bow and get this contestsettled."
on this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door[that led into the house] with the arrow standing against the top ofthe bow. then he sat down on the seat from which he had risen, andantinous said:
"come on each of you in his turn, going towards the right from theplace at which the. cupbearer begins when he is handing round thewine."
the rest agreed, and leiodes son of oenops was the first to rise. hewas sacrificial priest to the suitors, and sat in the corner nearthe mixing-bowl. he was the only man who hated their evil deeds andwas indignant with the others. he was now the first to take the bowand arrow, so he went on to the pavement to make his trial, but hecould not string the bow, for his hands were weak and unused to hardwork, they therefore soon grew tired, and he said to the suitors,"my friends, i cannot string it; let another have it; this bow shalltake the life and soul out of many a chief among us, for it isbetter to die than to live after having missed the prize that wehave so long striven for, and which has brought us so long together.some one of us is even now hoping and praying that he may marrypenelope, but when he has seen this bow and tried it, let him wooand make bridal offerings to some other woman, and let penelopemarry whoever makes her the best offer and whose lot it is to winher."
on this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door,with the arrow standing against the tip of the bow. then he took hisseat again on the seat from which he had risen; and antinous rebukedhim saying:
"leiodes, what are you talking about? your words are monstrous andintolerable; it makes me angry to listen to you. shall, then, this bowtake the life of many a chief among us, merely because you cannot bendit yourself? true, you were not born to be an archer, but there areothers who will soon string it."
then he said to melanthius the goatherd, "look sharp, light a firein the court, and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring usalso a large ball of lard, from what they have in the house. let uswarm the bow and grease it we will then make trial of it again, andbring the contest to an end."
melanthius lit the fire, and set a seat covered with sheep skinsbeside it. he also brought a great ball of lard from what they hadin the house, and the suitors warmed the bow and again made trial ofit, but they were none of them nearly strong enough to string it.nevertheless there still remained antinous and eurymachus, who werethe ringleaders among the suitors and much the foremost among themall.
then the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together, andulysses followed them. when they had got outside the gates and theouter yard, ulysses said to them quietly:
"stockman, and you swineherd, i have something in my mind which i amin doubt whether to say or no; but i think i will say it. whatmanner of men would you be to stand by ulysses, if some god shouldbring him back here all of a sudden? say which you are disposed to do-to side with the suitors, or with ulysses?"
"father jove," answered the stockman, "would indeed that you mightso ordain it. if some god were but to bring ulysses back, you shouldsee with what might and main i would fight for him."
in like words eumaeus prayed to all the gods that ulysses mightreturn; when, therefore, he saw for certain what mind they were of,ulysses said, "it is i, ulysses, who am here. i have suffered much,but at last, in the twentieth year, i am come back to my owncountry. i find that you two alone of all my servants are glad thati should do so, for i have not heard any of the others praying formy return. to you two, therefore, will i unfold the truth as itshall be. if heaven shall deliver the suitors into my hands, i willfind wives for both of you, will give you house and holding close tomy own, and you shall be to me as though you were brothers and friendsof telemachus. i will now give you convincing proofs that you may knowme and be assured. see, here is the scar from the boar's tooth thatripped me when i was out hunting on mount parnassus with the sons ofautolycus."
as he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar, and whenthey had examined it thoroughly, they both of them wept about ulysses,threw their arms round him and kissed his head and shoulders, whileulysses kissed their hands and faces in return. the sun would havegone down upon their mourning if ulysses had not checked them andsaid:
"cease your weeping, lest some one should come outside and see us,and tell those who a are within. when you go in, do so separately, notboth together; i will go first, and do you follow afterwards; let thismoreover be the token between us; the suitors will all of them tryto prevent me from getting hold of the bow and quiver; do you,therefore, eumaeus, place it in my hands when you are carrying itabout, and tell the women to close the doors of their apartment. ifthey hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house,they must not come out; they must keep quiet, and stay where theyare at their work. and i charge you, philoetius, to make fast thedoors of the outer court, and to bind them securely at once."
when he had thus spoken, he went back to the house and took the seatthat he had left. presently, his two servants followed him inside.
at this moment the bow was in the hands of eurymachus, who waswarming it by the fire, but even so he could not string it, and he wasgreatly grieved. he heaved a deep sigh and said, "i grieve formyself and for us all; i grieve that i shall have to forgo themarriage, but i do not care nearly so much about this, for there areplenty of other women in ithaca and elsewhere; what i feel most is thefact of our being so inferior to ulysses in strength that we cannotstring his bow. this will disgrace us in the eyes of those who are yetunborn."
"it shall not be so, eurymachus," said antinous, "and you know ityourself. to-day is the feast of apollo throughout all the land; whocan string a bow on such a day as this? put it on one side- as for theaxes they can stay where they are, for no one is likely to come to thehouse and take them away: let the cupbearer go round with his cups,that we may make our drink-offerings and drop this matter of thebow; we will tell melanthius to bring us in some goats to-morrow-the best he has; we can then offer thigh bones to apollo the mightyarcher, and again make trial of the bow, so as to bring the contest toan end."
the rest approved his words, and thereon men servants poured waterover the hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls withwine and water and handed it round after giving every man hisdrink-offering. then, when they had made their offerings and had drunkeach as much as he desired, ulysses craftily said:
"suitors of the illustrious queen, listen that i may speak even as iam minded. i appeal more especially to eurymachus, and to antinous whohas just spoken with so much reason. cease shooting for the presentand leave the matter to the gods, but in the morning let heaven givevictory to whom it will. for the moment, however, give me the bow thati may prove the power of my hands among you all, and see whether istill have as much strength as i used to have, or whether travel andneglect have made an end of it."
this made them all very angry, for they feared he might string thebow; antinous therefore rebuked him fiercely saying, "wretchedcreature, you have not so much as a grain of sense in your whole body;you ought to think yourself lucky in being allowed to dine unharmedamong your betters, without having any smaller portion served you thanwe others have had, and in being allowed to hear our conversation.no other beggar or stranger has been allowed to hear what we say amongourselves; the wine must have been doing you a mischief, as it doeswith all those drink immoderately. it was wine that inflamed thecentaur eurytion when he was staying with peirithous among thelapithae. when the wine had got into his head he went mad and didill deeds about the house of peirithous; this angered the heroes whowere there assembled, so they rushed at him and cut off his ears andnostrils; then they dragged him through the doorway out of thehouse, so he went away crazed, and bore the burden of his crime,bereft of understanding. henceforth, therefore, there was warbetween mankind and the centaurs, but he brought it upon himselfthrough his own drunkenness. in like manner i can tell you that itwill go hardly with you if you string the bow: you will find nomercy from any one here, for we shall at once ship you off to kingechetus, who kills every one that comes near him: you will never getaway alive, so drink and keep quiet without getting into a quarrelwith men younger than yourself."
penelope then spoke to him. "antinous," said she, "it is not rightthat you should ill-treat any guest of telemachus who comes to thishouse. if the stranger should prove strong enough to string the mightybow of ulysses, can you suppose that he would take me home with himand make me his wife? even the man himself can have no such idea inhis mind: none of you need let that disturb his feasting; it wouldbe out of all reason."
"queen penelope," answered eurymachus, "we do not suppose thatthis man will take you away with him; it is impossible; but we areafraid lest some of the baser sort, men or women among the achaeans,should go gossiping about and say, 'these suitors are a feeble folk;they are paying court to the wife of a brave man whose bow not oneof them was able to string, and yet a beggarly tramp who came to thehouse strung it at once and sent an arrow through the iron.' this iswhat will be said, and it will be a scandal against us."
"eurymachus," penelope answered, "people who persist in eating upthe estate of a great chieftain and dishonouring his house must notexpect others to think well of them. why then should you mind if mentalk as you think they will? this stranger is strong and well-built,he says moreover that he is of noble birth. give him the bow, andlet us see whether he can string it or no. i say- and it shallsurely be- that if apollo vouchsafes him the glory of stringing it,i will give him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a javelin to keepoff dogs and robbers, and a sharp sword. i will also give him sandals,and will see him sent safely whereever he wants to go."
then telemachus said, "mother, i am the only man either in ithaca orin the islands that are over against elis who has the right to let anyone have the bow or to refuse it. no one shall force me one way or theother, not even though i choose to make the stranger a present ofthe bow outright, and let him take it away with him. go, then,within the house and busy yourself with your daily duties, yourloom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants. this bow is aman's matter, and mine above all others, for it is i who am masterhere."
she went wondering back into the house, and laid her son's saying inher heart. then going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, shemourned her dear husband till minerva sent sweet sleep over hereyelids.
the swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it toulysses, but the suitors clamoured at him from all parts of thecloisters, and one of them said, "you idiot, where are you takingthe bow to? are you out of your wits? if apollo and the other godswill grant our prayer, your own boarhounds shall get you into somequiet little place, and worry you to death."
eumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised, so he putthe bow down then and there, but telemachus shouted out at him fromthe other side of the cloisters, and threatened him saying, "fathereumaeus, bring the bow on in spite of them, or young as i am i willpelt you with stones back to the country, for i am the better man ofthe two. i wish i was as much stronger than all the other suitors inthe house as i am than you, i would soon send some of them off sickand sorry, for they mean mischief."
thus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily, whichput them in a better humour with telemachus; so eumaeus brought thebow on and placed it in the hands of ulysses. when he had done this,he called euryclea apart and said to her, "euryclea, telemachus saysyou are to close the doors of the women's apartments. if they hear anygroaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house, they are not tocome out, but are to keep quiet and stay where they are at theirwork."
euryclea did as she was told and closed the doors of the women'sapartments.
meanwhile philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gatesof the outer court. there was a ship's cable of byblus fibre lyingin the gatehouse, so he made the gates fast with it and then came inagain, resuming the seat that he had left, and keeping an eye onulysses, who had now got the bow in his hands, and was turning itevery way about, and proving it all over to see whether the wormshad been eating into its two horns during his absence. then wouldone turn towards his neighbour saying, "this is some tricky oldbow-fancier; either he has got one like it at home, or he wants tomake one, in such workmanlike style does the old vagabond handle it."
another said, "i hope he may be no more successful in other thingsthan he is likely to be in stringing this bow."
but ulysses, when he had taken it up and examined it all over,strung it as easily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyreand makes the twisted gut fast at both ends. then he took it in hisright hand to prove the string, and it sang sweetly under his touchlike the twittering of a swallow. the suitors were dismayed, andturned colour as they heard it; at that moment, moreover, jovethundered loudly as a sign, and the heart of ulysses rejoiced as heheard the omen that the son of scheming saturn had sent him.
he took an arrow that was lying upon the table- for those whichthe achaeans were so shortly about to taste were all inside thequiver- he laid it on the centre-piece of the bow, and drew thenotch of the arrow and the string toward him, still seated on hisseat. when he had taken aim he let fly, and his arrow pierced everyone of the handle-holes of the axes from the first onwards till it hadgone right through them, and into the outer courtyard. then he said totelemachus:
"your guest has not disgraced you, telemachus. i did not miss what iaimed at, and i was not long in stringing my bow. i am still strong,and not as the suitors twit me with being. now, however, it is timefor the achaeans to prepare supper while there is still daylight,and then otherwise to disport themselves with song and dance which arethe crowning ornaments of a banquet."
as he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows, and telemachusgirded on his sword, grasped his spear, and stood armed beside hisfather's seat.
book xxii.
then ulysses tore off his rags, and sprang on to the broadpavement with his bow and his quiver full of arrows. he shed thearrows on to the ground at his feet and said, "the mighty contest isat an end. i will now see whether apollo will vouchsafe it to me tohit another mark which no man has yet hit."
on this he aimed a deadly arrow at antinous, who was about to takeup a two-handled gold cup to drink his wine and already had it inhis hands. he had no thought of death- who amongst all the revellerswould think that one man, however brave, would stand alone among somany and kill him? the arrow struck antinous in the throat, and thepoint went clean through his neck, so that he fell over and the cupdropped from his hand, while a thick stream of blood gushed from hisnostrils. he kicked the table from him and upset the things on it,so that the bread and roasted meats were all soiled as they fellover on to the ground. the suitors were in an uproar when they sawthat a man had been hit; they sprang in dismay one and all of themfrom their seats and looked everywhere towards the walls, but therewas neither shield nor spear, and they rebuked ulysses very angrily."stranger," said they, "you shall pay for shooting people in this way:om yi you shall see no other contest; you are a doomed man; he whomyou have slain was the foremost youth in ithaca, and the vulturesshall devour you for having killed him."
thus they spoke, for they thought that he had killed antinous bymistake, and did not perceive that death was hanging over the headof every one of them. but ulysses glared at them and said:
"dogs, did you think that i should not come back from troy? you havewasted my substance, have forced my women servants to lie with you,and have wooed my wife while i was still living. you have fearedneither cod nor man, and now you shall die."
they turned pale with fear as he spoke, and every man looked roundabout to see whither he might fly for safety, but eurymachus alonespoke.
"if you are ulysses," said he, "then what you have said is just.we have done much wrong on your lands and in your house. butantinous who was the head and front of the offending lies low already.it was all his doing. it was not that he wanted to marry penelope;he did not so much care about that; what he wanted was something quitedifferent, and jove has not vouchsafed it to him; he wanted to killyour son and to be chief man in ithaca. now, therefore, that he hasmet the death which was his due, spare the lives of your people. wewill make everything good among ourselves, and pay you in full for allthat we have eaten and drunk. each one of us shall pay you a fineworth twenty oxen, and we will keep on giving you gold and bronze tillyour heart is softened. until we have done this no one can complain ofyour being enraged against us."
ulysses again glared at him and said, "though you should give me allthat you have in the world both now and all that you ever shallhave, i will not stay my hand till i have paid all of you in full. youmust fight, or fly for your lives; and fly, not a man of you shall."
their hearts sank as they heard him, but eurymachus again spokesaying:
"my friends, this man will give us no quarter. he will stand wherehe is and shoot us down till he has killed every man among us. letus then show fight; draw your swords, and hold up the tables to shieldyou from his arrows. let us have at him with a rush, to drive him fromthe pavement and doorway: we can then get through into the town, andraise such an alarm as shall soon stay his shooting."
as he spoke he drew his keen blade of bronze, sharpened on bothsides, and with a loud cry sprang towards ulysses, but ulyssesinstantly shot an arrow into his breast that caught him by thenipple and fixed itself in his liver. he dropped his sword and felldoubled up over his table. the cup and all the meats went over on tothe ground as he smote the earth with his forehead in the agonies ofdeath, and he kicked the stool with his feet until his eyes wereclosed in darkness.
then amphinomus drew his sword and made straight at ulysses to tryand get him away from the door; but telemachus was too quick forhim, and struck him from behind; the spear caught him between theshoulders and went right through his chest, so that he fell heavily tothe ground and struck the earth with his forehead. then telemachussprang away from him, leaving his spear still in the body, for hefeared that if he stayed to draw it out, some one of the achaeansmight come up and hack at him with his sword, or knock him down, so heset off at a run, and immediately was at his father's side. then hesaid:
"father, let me bring you a shield, two spears, and a brass helmetfor your temples. i will arm myself as well, and will bring otherarmour for the swineherd and the stockman, for we had better bearmed."
"run and fetch them," answered ulysses, "while my arrows hold out,or when i am alone they may get me away from the door."
telemachus did as his father said, and went off to the store roomwhere the armour was kept. he chose four shields, eight spears, andfour brass helmets with horse-hair plumes. he brought them with allspeed to his father, and armed himself first, while the stockman andthe swineherd also put on their armour, and took their places nearulysses. meanwhile ulysses, as long as his arrows lasted, had beenshooting the suitors one by one, and they fell thick on one another:when his arrows gave out, he set the bow to stand against the end wallof the house by the door post, and hung a shield four hides thickabout his shoulders; on his comely head he set his helmet, wellwrought with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it,and he grasped two redoubtable bronze-shod spears.
now there was a trap door on the wall, while at one end of thepavement there was an exit leading to a narrow passage, and thisexit was closed by a well-made door. ulysses told philoetius tostand by this door and guard it, for only one person could attack itat a time. but agelaus shouted out, "cannot some one go up to the trapdoor and tell the people what is going on? help would come at once,and we should soon make an end of this man and his shooting."
"this may not be, agelaus," answered melanthius, "the mouth of thenarrow passage is dangerously near the entrance to the outer court.one brave man could prevent any number from getting in. but i knowwhat i will do, i will bring you arms from the store room, for i amsure it is there that ulysses and his son have put them."
on this the goatherd melanthius went by back passages to the storeroom of ulysses, house. there he chose twelve shields, with as manyhelmets and spears, and brought them back as fast as he could togive them to the suitors. ulysses' heart began to fail him when he sawthe suitors putting on their armour and brandishing their spears. hesaw the greatness of the danger, and said to telemachus, "some oneof the women inside is helping the suitors against us, or it may bemelanthius."
telemachus answered, "the fault, father, is mine, and mine only; ileft the store room door open, and they have kept a sharper look outthan i have. go, eumaeus, put the door to, and see whether it is oneof the women who is doing this, or whether, as i suspect, it ismelanthius the son of dolius."
thus did they converse. meanwhile melanthius was again going tothe store room to fetch more armour, but the swineherd saw him andsaid to ulysses who was beside him, "ulysses, noble son of laertes, itis that scoundrel melanthius, just as we suspected, who is going tothe store room. say, shall i kill him, if i can get the better of him,or shall i bring him here that you may take your own revenge for allthe many wrongs that he has done in your house?"
ulysses answered, "telemachus and i will hold these suitors incheck, no matter what they do; go back both of you and bindmelanthius' hands and feet behind him. throw him into the store roomand make the door fast behind you; then fasten a noose about his body,and string him close up to the rafters from a high bearing-post,that he may linger on in an agony."
thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said; they went tothe store room, which they entered before melanthius saw them, forhe was busy searching for arms in the innermost part of the room, sothe two took their stand on either side of the door and waited. by andby melanthius came out with a helmet in one hand, and an olddry-rotted shield in the other, which had been borne by laertes whenhe was young, but which had been long since thrown aside, and thestraps had become unsewn; on this the two seized him, dragged him backby the hair, and threw him struggling to the ground. they bent hishands and feet well behind his back, and bound them tight with apainful bond as ulysses had told them; then they fastened a nooseabout his body and strung him up from a high pillar till he wasclose up to the rafters, and over him did you then vaunt, oswineherd eumaeus, saying, "melanthius, you will pass the night on asoft bed as you deserve. you will know very well when morning comesfrom the streams of oceanus, and it is time for you to be driving inyour goats for the suitors to feast on."
there, then, they left him in very cruel bondage, and having puton their armour they closed the door behind them and went back to taketheir places by the side of ulysses; whereon the four men stood in thecloister, fierce and full of fury; nevertheless, those who were in thebody of the court were still both brave and many. then jove's daughterminerva came up to them, having assumed the voice and form ofmentor. ulysses was glad when he saw her and said, "mentor, lend meyour help, and forget not your old comrade, nor the many good turns hehas done you. besides, you are my age-mate."
but all the time he felt sure it was minerva, and the suitors fromthe other side raised an uproar when they saw her. agelaus was thefirst to reproach her. "mentor," he cried, "do not let ulysses beguileyou into siding with him and fighting the suitors. this is what wewill do: when we have killed these people, father and son, we willkill you too. you shall pay for it with your head, and when we havekilled you, we will take all you have, in doors or out, and bring itinto hotch-pot with ulysses' property; we will not let your sonslive in your house, nor your daughters, nor shall your widowcontinue to live in the city of ithaca."
this made minerva still more furious, so she scolded ulysses veryangrily. "ulysses," said she, "your strength and prowess are no longerwhat they were when you fought for nine long years among the trojansabout the noble lady helen. you killed many a man in those days, andit was through your stratagem that priam's city was taken. how comesit that you are so lamentably less valiant now that you are on yourown ground, face to face with the suitors in your own house? comeon, my good fellow, stand by my side and see how mentor, son ofalcinous shall fight your foes and requite your kindnesses conferredupon him."
but she would not give him full victory as yet, for she wished stillfurther to prove his own prowess and that of his brave son, so sheflew up to one of the rafters in the roof of the cloister and sat uponit in the form of a swallow.
meanwhile agelaus son of damastor, eurynomus, amphimedon,demoptolemus, pisander, and polybus son of polyctor bore the bruntof the fight upon the suitors' side; of all those who were stillfighting for their lives they were by far the most valiant, for theothers had already fallen under the arrows of ulysses. agelaus shoutedto them and said, "my friends, he will soon have to leave off, formentor has gone away after having done nothing for him but brag.they are standing at the doors unsupported. do not aim at him all atonce, but six of you throw your spears first, and see if you cannotcover yourselves with glory by killing him. when he has fallen we neednot be uneasy about the others."
they threw their spears as he bade them, but minerva made them allof no effect. one hit the door post; another went against the door;the pointed shaft of another struck the wall; and as soon as theyhad avoided all the spears of the suitors ulysses said to his own men,"my friends, i should say we too had better let drive into themiddle of them, or they will crown all the harm they have done us byus outright."
they therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw theirspears. ulysses killed demoptolemus, telemachus euryades, eumaeuselatus, while the stockman killed pisander. these all bit the dust,and as the others drew back into a corner ulysses and his men rushedforward and regained their spears by drawing them from the bodies ofthe dead.
the suitors now aimed a second time, but again minerva made theirweapons for the most part without effect. one hit a bearing-post ofthe cloister; another went against the door; while the pointed shaftof another struck the wall. still, amphimedon just took a piece of thetop skin from off telemachus's wrist, and ctesippus managed to grazeeumaeus's shoulder above his shield; but the spear went on and fell tothe ground. then ulysses and his men let drive into the crowd ofsuitors. ulysses hit eurydamas, telemachus amphimedon, and eumaeuspolybus. after this the stockman hit ctesippus in the breast, andtaunted him saying, "foul-mouthed son of polytherses, do not be sofoolish as to talk wickedly another time, but let heaven direct yourspeech, for the gods are far stronger than men. i make you a presentof this advice to repay you for the foot which you gave ulysses whenhe was begging about in his own house."
thus spoke the stockman, and ulysses struck the son of damastor witha spear in close fight, while telemachus hit leocritus son of evenorin the belly, and the dart went clean through him, so that he fellforward full on his face upon the ground. then minerva from her seaton the rafter held up her deadly aegis, and the hearts of thesuitors quailed. they fled to the other end of the court like a herdof cattle maddened by the gadfly in early summer when the days areat their longest. as eagle-beaked, crook-taloned vultures from themountains swoop down on the smaller birds that cower in flocks uponthe ground, and kill them, for they cannot either fight or fly, andlookers on enjoy the sport- even so did ulysses and his men fallupon the suitors and smite them on every side. they made a horriblegroaning as their brains were being battered in, and the groundseethed with their blood.
leiodes then caught the knees of ulysses and said, "ulysses ibeseech you have mercy upon me and spare me. i never wronged any ofthe women in your house either in word or deed, and i tried to stopthe others. i saw them, but they would not listen, and now they arepaying for their folly. i was their sacrificing priest; if you killme, i shall die without having done anything to deserve it, andshall have got no thanks for all the good that i did."
ulysses looked sternly at him and answered, "if you were theirsacrificing priest, you must have prayed many a time that it mightbe long before i got home again, and that you might marry my wifeand have children by her. therefore you shall die."
with these words he picked up the sword that agelaus had droppedwhen he was being killed, and which was lying upon the ground. then hestruck leiodes on the back of his neck, so that his head fellrolling in the dust while he was yet speaking.
the minstrel phemius son of terpes- he who had been forced by thesuitors to sing to them- now tried to save his life. he was standingnear towards the trap door, and held his lyre in his hand. he didnot know whether to fly out of the cloister and sit down by thealtar of jove that was in the outer court, and on which both laertesand ulysses had offered up the thigh bones of many an ox, or whetherto go straight up to ulysses and embrace his knees, but in the endhe deemed it best to embrace ulysses' knees. so he laid his lyre onthe ground the ground between the mixing-bowl and the silver-studdedseat; then going up to ulysses he caught hold of his knees and said,"ulysses, i beseech you have mercy on me and spare me. you will besorry for it afterwards if you kill a bard who can sing both forgods and men as i can. i make all my lays myself, and heaven visits mewith every kind of inspiration. i would sing to you as though you werea god, do not therefore be in such a hurry to cut my head off. yourown son telemachus will tell you that i did not want to frequentyour house and sing to the suitors after their meals, but they weretoo many and too strong for me, so they made me."
telemachus heard him, and at once went up to his father. "hold!"he cried, "the man is guiltless, do him no hurt; and we will medontoo, who was always good to me when i was a boy, unless philoetiusor eumaeus has already killed him, or he has fallen in your way whenyou were raging about the court."
medon caught these words of telemachus, for he was crouching under aseat beneath which he had hidden by covering himself up with a freshlyflayed heifer's hide, so he threw off the hide, went up to telemachus,and laid hold of his knees.
"here i am, my dear sir," said he, "stay your hand therefore, andtell your father, or he will kill me in his rage against the suitorsfor having wasted his substance and been so foolishly disrespectful toyourself."
ulysses smiled at him and answered, "fear not; telemachus hassaved your life, that you may know in future, and tell other people,how greatly better good deeds prosper than evil ones. go, therefore,outside the cloisters into the outer court, and be out of the way ofthe slaughter- you and the bard- while i finish my work here inside."
the pair went into the outer court as fast as they could, and satdown by jove's great altar, looking fearfully round, and stillexpecting that they would be killed. then ulysses searched the wholecourt carefully over, to see if anyone had managed to hide himself andwas still living, but he found them all lying in the dust andweltering in their blood. they were like fishes which fishermen havenetted out of the sea, and thrown upon the beach to lie gasping forwater till the heat of the sun makes an end of them. even so werethe suitors lying all huddled up one against the other.
then ulysses said to telemachus, "call nurse euryclea; i havesomething to say to her."
telemachus went and knocked at the door of the women's room. "makehaste," said he, "you old woman who have been set over all the otherwomen in the house. come outside; my father wishes to speak to you."
when euryclea heard this she unfastened the door of the women's roomand came out, following telemachus. she found ulysses among thecorpses bespattered with blood and filth like a lion that has justbeen devouring an ox, and his breast and both his cheeks are allbloody, so that he is a fearful sight; even so was ulyssesbesmirched from head to foot with gore. when she saw all the corpsesand such a quantity of blood, she was beginning to cry out for joy,for she saw that a great deed had been done; but ulysses checkedher, "old woman," said he, "rejoice in silence; restrain yourself, anddo not make any noise about it; it is an unholy thing to vaunt overdead men. heaven's doom and their own evil deeds have brought thesemen to destruction, for they respected no man in the whole world,neither rich nor poor, who came near them, and they have come to a badend as a punishment for their wickedness and folly. now, however, tellme which of the women in the house have misconducted themselves, andwho are innocent."
"i will tell you the truth, my son," answered euryclea. "there arefifty women in the house whom we teach to do things, such as cardingwool, and all kinds of household work. of these, twelve in all havemisbehaved, and have been wanting in respect to me, and also topenelope. they showed no disrespect to telemachus, for he has onlylately grown and his mother never permitted him to give orders tothe female servants; but let me go upstairs and tell your wife allthat has happened, for some god has been sending her to sleep."
"do not wake her yet," answered ulysses, "but tell the women whohave misconducted themselves to come to me."
euryclea left the cloister to tell the women, and make them cometo ulysses; in the meantime he called telemachus, the stockman, andthe swineherd. "begin," said he, "to remove the dead, and make thewomen help you. then, get sponges and clean water to swill down thetables and seats. when you have thoroughly cleansed the wholecloisters, take the women into the space between the domed room andthe wall of the outer court, and run them through with your swordstill they are quite dead, and have forgotten all about love and theway in which they used to lie in secret with the suitors."
on this the women came down in a body, weeping and wailing bitterly.first they carried the dead bodies out, and propped them up againstone another in the gatehouse. ulysses ordered them about and made themdo their work quickly, so they had to carry the bodies out. whenthey had done this, they cleaned all the tables and seats with spongesand water, while telemachus and the two others shovelled up theblood and dirt from the ground, and the women carried it all awayand put it out of doors. then when they had made the whole place quiteclean and orderly, they took the women out and hemmed them in thenarrow space between the wall of the domed room and that of theyard, so that they could not get away: and telemachus said to theother two, "i shall not let these women die a clean death, for theywere insolent to me and my mother, and used to sleep with thesuitors."
so saying he made a ship's cable fast to one of the bearing-poststhat supported the roof of the domed room, and secured it all aroundthe building, at a good height, lest any of the women's feet shouldtouch the ground; and as thrushes or doves beat against a net that hasbeen set for them in a thicket just as they were getting to theirnest, and a terrible fate awaits them, even so did the women have toput their heads in nooses one after the other and die mostmiserably. their feet moved convulsively for a while, but not for verylong.
as for melanthius, they took him through the cloister into the innercourt. there they cut off his nose and his ears; they drew out hisvitals and gave them to the dogs raw, and then in their fury theycut off his hands and his feet.
when they had done this they washed their hands and feet and wentback into the house, for all was now over; and ulysses said to thedear old nurse euryclea, "bring me sulphur, which cleanses allpollution, and fetch fire also that i may burn it, and purify thecloisters. go, moreover, and tell penelope to come here with herattendants, and also all the maid servants that are in the house."
"all that you have said is true," answered euryclea, "but let mebring you some clean clothes- a shirt and cloak. do not keep theserags on your back any longer. it is not right."
"first light me a fire," replied ulysses.
she brought the fire and sulphur, as he had bidden her, andulysses thoroughly purified the cloisters and both the inner and outercourts. then she went inside to call the women and tell them whathad happened; whereon they came from their apartment with torches intheir hands, and pressed round ulysses to embrace him, kissing hishead and shoulders and taking hold of his hands. it made him feel asif he should like to weep, for he remembered every one of them.
book xxiii.
euryclea now went upstairs laughing to tell her mistress that herdear husband had come home. her aged knees became young again andher feet were nimble for joy as she went up to her mistress and bentover her head to speak to her. "wake up penelope, my dear child,"she exclaimed, "and see with your own eyes something that you havebeen wanting this long time past. ulysses has at last indeed come homeagain, and has killed the suitors who were giving so much trouble inhis house, eating up his estate and ill-treating his son."
"my good nurse," answered penelope, "you must be mad. the godssometimes send some very sensible people out of their minds, andmake foolish people become sensible. this is what they must havebeen doing to you; for you always used to be a reasonable person.why should you thus mock me when i have trouble enough already-talking such nonsense, and waking me up out of a sweet sleep thathad taken possession of my eyes and closed them? i have never slept sosoundly from the day my poor husband went to that city with theill-omened name. go back again into the women's room; if it had beenany one else, who had woke me up to bring me such absurd news i shouldhave sent her away with a severe scolding. as it is, your age shallprotect you."
"my dear child," answered euryclea, "i am not mocking you. it isquite true as i tell you that ulysses is come home again. he was thestranger whom they all kept on treating so badly in the cloister.telemachus knew all the time that he was come back, but kept hisfather's secret that he might have his revenge on all these wickedpeople.
then penelope sprang up from her couch, threw her arms roundeuryclea, and wept for joy. "but my dear nurse," said she, "explainthis to me; if he has really come home as you say, how did he manageto overcome the wicked suitors single handed, seeing what a numberof them there always were?"
"i was not there," answered euryclea, "and do not know; i only heardthem groaning while they were being killed. we sat crouching andhuddled up in a corner of the women's room with the doors closed, tillyour son came to fetch me because his father sent him. then i foundulysses standing over the corpses that were lying on the ground allround him, one on top of the other. you would have enjoyed it if youcould have seen him standing there all bespattered with blood andfilth, and looking just like a lion. but the corpses are now all piledup in the gatehouse that is in the outer court, and ulysses has lita great fire to purify the house with sulphur. he has sent me tocall you, so come with me that you may both be happy together afterall; for now at last the desire of your heart has been fulfilled; yourhusband is come home to find both wife and son alive and well, andto take his revenge in his own house on the suitors who behaved sobadly to him."
"'my dear nurse," said penelope, "do not exult too confidentlyover all this. you know how delighted every one would be to seeulysses come home- more particularly myself, and the son who hasbeen born to both of us; but what you tell me cannot be really true.it is some god who is angry with the suitors for their greatwickedness, and has made an end of them; for they respected no manin the whole world, neither rich nor poor, who came near them, whocame near them, and they have come to a bad end in consequence oftheir iniquity. ulysses is dead far away from the achaean land; hewill never return home again."
then nurse euryclea said, "my child, what are you talking about? butyou were all hard of belief and have made up your mind that yourhusband is never coming, although he is in the house and by his ownfire side at this very moment. besides i can give you another proof;when i was washing him i perceived the scar which the wild boar gavehim, and i wanted to tell you about it, but in his wisdom he would notlet me, and clapped his hands over my mouth; so come with me and iwill make this bargain with you- if i am deceiving you, you may haveme killed by the most cruel death you can think of."
"my dear nurse," said penelope, "however wise you may be you canhardly fathom the counsels of the gods. nevertheless, we will go insearch of my son, that i may see the corpses of the suitors, and theman who has killed them."
on this she came down from her upper room, and while doing so sheconsidered whether she should keep at a distance from her husbandand question him, or whether she should at once go up to him andembrace him. when, however, she had crossed the stone floor of thecloister, she sat down opposite ulysses by the fire, against thewall at right angles [to that by which she had entered], while ulyssessat near one of the bearing-posts, looking upon the ground, andwaiting to see what his wife would say to him when she saw him. fora long time she sat silent and as one lost in amazement. at one momentshe looked him full in the face, but then again directly, she wasmisled by his shabby clothes and failed to recognize him, tilltelemachus began to reproach her and said:
"mother- but you are so hard that i cannot call you by such aname- why do you keep away from my father in this way? why do younot sit by his side and begin talking to him and asking him questions?no other woman could bear to keep away from her husband when he hadcome back to her after twenty years of absence, and after havinggone through so much; but your heart always was as hard as a stone."
penelope answered, "my son, i am so lost in astonishment that ican find no words in which either to ask questions or to answerthem. i cannot even look him straight in the face. still, if he reallyis ulysses come back to his own home again, we shall get to understandone another better by and by, for there are tokens with which we twoare alone acquainted, and which are hidden from all others."
ulysses smiled at this, and said to telemachus, "let your mother putme to any proof she likes; she will make up her mind about itpresently. she rejects me for the moment and believes me to besomebody else, because i am covered with dirt and have such badclothes on; let us, however, consider what we had better do next. whenone man has killed another, even though he was not one who would leavemany friends to take up his quarrel, the man who has killed him muststill say good bye to his friends and fly the country; whereas we havebeen killing the stay of a whole town, and all the picked youth ofithaca. i would have you consider this matter."
"look to it yourself, father," answered telemachus, "for they sayyou are the wisest counsellor in the world, and that there is no othermortal man who can compare with you. we will follow you with rightgood will, nor shall you find us fail you in so far as our strengthholds out."
"i will say what i think will be best," answered ulysses. "firstwash and put your shirts on; tell the maids also to go to their ownroom and dress; phemius shall then strike up a dance tune on his lyre,so that if people outside hear, or any of the neighbours, or someone going along the street happens to notice it, they may thinkthere is a wedding in the house, and no rumours about the death of thesuitors will get about in the town, before we can escape to thewoods upon my own land. once there, we will settle which of thecourses heaven vouchsafes us shall seem wisest."
thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. first theywashed and put their shirts on, while the women got ready. thenphemius took his lyre and set them all longing for sweet song andstately dance. the house re-echoed with the sound of men and womendancing, and the people outside said, "i suppose the queen has beengetting married at last. she ought to be ashamed of herself for notcontinuing to protect her husband's property until he comes home."
this was what they said, but they did not know what it was thathad been happening. the upper servant eurynome washed and anointedulysses in his own house and gave him a shirt and cloak, while minervamade him look taller and stronger than before; she also made thehair grow thick on the top of his head, and flow down in curls likehyacinth blossoms; she glorified him about the head and shoulders justas a skilful workman who has studied art of all kinds under vulcanor minerva- and his work is full of beauty- enriches a piece of silverplate by gilding it. he came from the bath looking like one of theimmortals, and sat down opposite his wife on the seat he had left. "mydear," said he, "heaven has endowed you with a heart more unyieldingthan woman ever yet had. no other woman could bear to keep away fromher husband when he had come back to her after twenty years ofabsence, and after having gone through so much. but come, nurse, get abed ready for me; i will sleep alone, for this woman has a heart ashard as iron."
"my dear," answered penelope, "i have no wish to set myself up,nor to depreciate you; but i am not struck by your appearance, for ivery well remember what kind of a man you were when you set sailfrom ithaca. nevertheless, euryclea, take his bed outside the bedchamber that he himself built. bring the bed outside this room, andput bedding upon it with fleeces, good coverlets, and blankets."
she said this to try him, but ulysses was very angry and said,"wife, i am much displeased at what you have just been saying. who hasbeen taking my bed from the place in which i left it? he must havefound it a hard task, no matter how skilled a workman he was, unlesssome god came and helped him to shift it. there is no man living,however strong and in his prime, who could move it from its place, forit is a marvellous curiosity which i made with my very own hands.there was a young olive growing within the precincts of the house,in full vigour, and about as thick as a bearing-post. i built myroom round this with strong walls of stone and a roof to cover them,and i made the doors strong and well-fitting. then i cut off the topboughs of the olive tree and left the stump standing. this i dressedroughly from the root upwards and then worked with carpenter's toolswell and skilfully, straightening my work by drawing a line on thewood, and making it into a bed-prop. i then bored a hole down themiddle, and made it the centre-post of my bed, at which i workedtill i had finished it, inlaying it with gold and silver; after this istretched a hide of crimson leather from one side of it to theother. so you see i know all about it, and i desire to learn whetherit is still there, or whether any one has been removing it bycutting down the olive tree at its roots."
when she heard the sure proofs ulysses now gave her, she fairlybroke down. she flew weeping to his side, flung her arms about hisneck, and kissed him. "do not be angry with me ulysses," she cried,"you, who are the wisest of mankind. we have suffered, both of us.heaven has denied us the happiness of spending our youth, and ofgrowing old, together; do not then be aggrieved or take it amissthat i did not embrace you thus as soon as i saw you. i have beenshuddering all the time through fear that someone might come hereand deceive me with a lying story; for there are many very wickedpeople going about. jove's daughter helen would never have yieldedherself to a man from a foreign country, if she had known that thesons of achaeans would come after her and bring her back. heaven putit in her heart to do wrong, and she gave no thought to that sin,which has been the source of all our sorrows. now, however, that youhave convinced me by showing that you know all about our bed (which nohuman being has ever seen but you and i and a single maid servant, thedaughter of actor, who was given me by my father on my marriage, andwho keeps the doors of our room) hard of belief though i have been ican mistrust no longer."
then ulysses in his turn melted, and wept as he clasped his dear andfaithful wife to his bosom. as the sight of land is welcome to men whoare swimming towards the shore, when neptune has wrecked their shipwith the fury of his winds and waves- a few alone reach the land,and these, covered with brine, are thankful when they findthemselves on firm ground and out of danger- even so was her husbandwelcome to her as she looked upon him, and she could not tear hertwo fair arms from about his neck. indeed they would have gone onindulging their sorrow till rosy-fingered morn appeared, had notminerva determined otherwise, and held night back in the far west,while she would not suffer dawn to leave oceanus, nor to yoke thetwo steeds lampus and phaethon that bear her onward to break the dayupon mankind.
at last, however, ulysses said, "wife, we have not yet reached theend of our troubles. i have an unknown amount of toil still toundergo. it is long and difficult, but i must go through with it,for thus the shade of teiresias prophesied concerning me, on the daywhen i went down into hades to ask about my return and that of mycompanions. but now let us go to bed, that we may lie down and enjoythe blessed boon of sleep."
"you shall go to bed as soon as you please," replied penelope,"now that the gods have sent you home to your own good house and toyour country. but as heaven has put it in your mind to speak of it,tell me about the task that lies before you. i shall have to hearabout it later, so it is better that i should be told at once."
"my dear," answered ulysses, "why should you press me to tell you?still, i will not conceal it from you, though you will not like bookit. i do not like it myself, for teiresias bade me travel far andwide, carrying an oar, till i came to a country where the peoplehave never heard of the sea, and do not even mix salt with their food.they know nothing about ships, nor oars that are as the wings of aship. he gave me this certain token which i will not hide from you. hesaid that a wayfarer should meet me and ask me whether it was awinnowing shovel that i had on my shoulder. on this, i was to fix myoar in the ground and sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar toneptune; after which i was to go home and offer hecatombs to all thegods in heaven, one after the other. as for myself, he said that deathshould come to me from the sea, and that my life should ebb awayvery gently when i was full of years and peace of mind, and mypeople should bless me. all this, he said, should surely come topass."
and penelope said, "if the gods are going to vouchsafe you a happiertime in your old age, you may hope then to have some respite frommisfortune."
thus did they converse. meanwhile eurynome and the nurse tooktorches and made the bed ready with soft coverlets; as soon as theyhad laid them, the nurse went back into the house to go to her rest,leaving the bed chamber woman eurynome to show ulysses and penelope tobed by torch light. when she had conducted them to their room she wentback, and they then came joyfully to the rites of their own old bed.telemachus, philoetius, and the swineherd now left off dancing, andmade the women leave off also. they then laid themselves down to sleepin the cloisters.
when ulysses and penelope had had their fill of love they felltalking with one another. she told him how much she had had to bear inseeing the house filled with a crowd of wicked suitors who hadkilled so many sheep and oxen on her account, and had drunk so manycasks of wine. ulysses in his turn told her what he had suffered,and how much trouble he had himself given to other people. he told hereverything, and she was so delighted to listen that she never wentto sleep till he had ended his whole story.
he began with his victory over the cicons, and how he thence reachedthe fertile land of the lotus-eaters. he told her all about thecyclops and how he had punished him for having so ruthlessly eaten hisbrave comrades; how he then went on to aeolus, who received himhospitably and furthered him on his way, but even so he was not toreach home, for to his great grief a hurricane carried him out tosea again; how he went on to the laestrygonian city telepylos, wherethe people destroyed all his ships with their crews, save himselfand his own ship only. then he told of cunning circe and her craft,and how he sailed to the chill house of hades, to consult the ghost ofthe theban prophet teiresias, and how he saw his old comrades in arms,and his mother who bore him and brought him up when he was a child;how he then heard the wondrous singing of the sirens, and went on tothe wandering rocks and terrible charybdis and to scylla, whom noman had ever yet passed in safety; how his men then ate the cattleof the sun-god, and how jove therefore struck the ship with histhunderbolts, so that all his men perished together, himself alonebeing left alive; how at last he reached the ogygian island and thenymph calypso, who kept him there in a cave, and fed him, and wantedhim to marry her, in which case she intended making him immortal sothat he should never grow old, but she could not persuade him to lether do so; and how after much suffering he had found his way to thephaeacians, who had treated him as though he had been a god, andsent him back in a ship to his own country after having given himgold, bronze, and raiment in great abundance. this was the lastthing about which he told her, for here a deep sleep took hold uponhim and eased the burden of his sorrows.
then minerva bethought her of another matter. when she deemed thatulysses had had both of his wife and of repose, she badegold-enthroned dawn rise out of oceanus that she might shed light uponmankind. on this, ulysses rose from his comfortable bed and said topenelope, "wife, we have both of us had our full share of troubles,you, here, in lamenting my absence, and i in being prevented fromgetting home though i was longing all the time to do so. now, however,that we have at last come together, take care of the property thatis in the house. as for the sheep and goats which the wicked suitorshave eaten, i will take many myself by force from other people, andwill compel the achaeans to make good the rest till they shall havefilled all my yards. i am now going to the wooded lands out in thecountry to see my father who has so long been grieved on my account,and to yourself i will give these instructions, though you have littleneed of them. at sunrise it will at once get abroad that i have beenkilling the suitors; go upstairs, therefore, and stay there withyour women. see nobody and ask no questions."
as he spoke he girded on his armour. then he roused telemachus,philoetius, and eumaeus, and told them all to put on their armouralso. this they did, and armed themselves. when they had done so, theyopened the gates and sallied forth, ulysses leading the way. it wasnow daylight, but minerva nevertheless concealed them in darknessand led them quickly out of the town.
book xxiv.
then mercury of cyllene summoned the ghosts of the suitors, and inhis hand he held the fair golden wand with which he seals men's eyesin sleep or wakes them just as he pleases; with this he roused theghosts and led them, while they followed whining and gibberingbehind him. as bats fly squealing in the hollow of some great cave,when one of them has fallen out of the cluster in which they hang,even so did the ghosts whine and squeal as mercury the healer ofsorrow led them down into the dark abode of death. when they hadpassed the waters of oceanus and the rock leucas, they came to thegates of the sun and the land of dreams, whereon they reached themeadow of asphodel where dwell the souls and shadows of them thatcan labour no more.
here they found the ghost of achilles son of peleus, with those ofpatroclus, antilochus, and ajax, who was the finest and handsomest manof all the danaans after the son of peleus himself.
they gathered round the ghost of the son of peleus, and the ghost ofagamemnon joined them, sorrowing bitterly. round him were gatheredalso the ghosts of those who had perished with him in the house ofaeisthus; and the ghost of achilles spoke first.
"son of atreus," it said, "we used to say that jove had loved youbetter from first to last than any other hero, for you were captainover many and brave men, when we were all fighting together beforetroy; yet the hand of death, which no mortal can escape, was laid uponyou all too early. better for you had you fallen at troy in thehey-day of your renown, for the achaeans would have built a mound overyour ashes, and your son would have been heir to your good name,whereas it has now been your lot to come to a most miserable end."
"happy son of peleus," answered the ghost of agamemnon, "forhaving died at troy far from argos, while the bravest of the trojansand the achaeans fell round you fighting for your body. there youlay in the whirling clouds of dust, all huge and hugely, heedlessnow of your chivalry. we fought the whole of the livelong day, norshould we ever have left off if jove had not sent a hurricane tostay us. then, when we had borne you to the ships out of the fray,we laid you on your bed and cleansed your fair skin with warm waterand with ointments. the danaans tore their hair and wept bitterlyround about you. your mother, when she heard, came with her immortalnymphs from out of the sea, and the sound of a great wailing wentforth over the waters so that the achaeans quaked for fear. they wouldhave fled panic-stricken to their ships had not wise old nestorwhose counsel was ever truest checked them saying, 'hold, argives, flynot sons of the achaeans, this is his mother coming from the seawith her immortal nymphs to view the body of her son.'
"thus he spoke, and the achaeans feared no more. the daughters ofthe old man of the sea stood round you weeping bitterly, and clothedyou in immortal raiment. the nine muses also came and lifted uptheir sweet voices in lament- calling and answering one another; therewas not an argive but wept for pity of the dirge they chaunted. daysand nights seven and ten we mourned you, mortals and immortals, but onthe eighteenth day we gave you to the flames, and many a fat sheepwith many an ox did we slay in sacrifice around you. you were burnt inraiment of the gods, with rich resins and with honey, while heroes,horse and foot, clashed their armour round the pile as you wereburning, with the tramp as of a great multitude. but when the flamesof heaven had done their work, we gathered your white bones atdaybreak and laid them in ointments and in pure wine. your motherbrought us a golden vase to hold them- gift of bacchus, and work ofvulcan himself; in this we mingled your bleached bones with those ofpatroclus who had gone before you, and separate we enclosed also thoseof antilochus, who had been closer to you than any other of yourcomrades now that patroclus was no more.
"over these the host of the argives built a noble tomb, on a pointjutting out over the open hellespont, that it might be seen from farout upon the sea by those now living and by them that shall be bornhereafter. your mother begged prizes from the gods, and offered themto be contended for by the noblest of the achaeans. you must have beenpresent at the funeral of many a hero, when the young men girdthemselves and make ready to contend for prizes on the death of somegreat chieftain, but you never saw such prizes as silver-footed thetisoffered in your honour; for the gods loved you well. thus even indeath your fame, achilles, has not been lost, and your name livesevermore among all mankind. but as for me, what solace had i whenthe days of my fighting were done? for jove willed my destruction onmy return, by the hands of aegisthus and those of my wicked wife."
thus did they converse, and presently mercury came up to them withthe ghosts of the suitors who had been killed by ulysses. the ghostsof agamemnon and achilles were astonished at seeing them, and wentup to them at once. the ghost of agamemnon recognized amphimedon sonof melaneus, who lived in ithaca and had been his host, so it began totalk to him.
"amphimedon," it said, "what has happened to all you fine young men-all of an age too- that you are come down here under the ground? onecould pick no finer body of men from any city. did neptune raise hiswinds and waves against you when you were at sea, or did yourenemies make an end of you on the mainland when you werecattle-lifting or sheep-stealing, or while fighting in defence oftheir wives and city? answer my question, for i have been yourguest. do you not remember how i came to your house with menelaus,to persuade ulysses to join us with his ships against troy? it was awhole month ere we could resume our voyage, for we had hard work topersuade ulysses to come with us."
and the ghost of amphimedon answered, "agamemnon, son of atreus,king of men, i remember everything that you have said, and will tellyou fully and accurately about the way in which our end was broughtabout. ulysses had been long gone, and we were courting his wife,who did not say point blank that she would not marry, nor yet bringmatters to an end, for she meant to compass our destruction: this,then, was the trick she played us. she set up a great tambour frame inher room and began to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework.'sweethearts,' said she, 'ulysses is indeed dead, still, do notpress me to marry again immediately; wait- for i would not have myskill in needlework perish unrecorded- till i have completed a pallfor the hero laertes, against the time when death shall take him. heis very rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is laid outwithout a pall.' this is what she said, and we assented; whereuponwe could see her working upon her great web all day long, but at nightshe would unpick the stitches again by torchlight. she fooled us inthis way for three years without our finding it out, but as timewore on and she was now in her fourth year, in the waning of moons andmany days had been accomplished, one of her maids who knew what shewas doing told us, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work,so she had to finish it whether she would or no; and when she showedus the robe she had made, after she had had it washed, its splendourwas as that of the sun or moon.
"then some malicious god conveyed ulysses to the upland farm wherehis swineherd lives. thither presently came also his son, returningfrom a voyage to pylos, and the two came to the town when they hadhatched their plot for our destruction. telemachus came first, andthen after him, accompanied by the swineherd, came ulysses, clad inrags and leaning on a staff as though he were some miserable oldbeggar. he came so unexpectedly that none of us knew him, not even theolder ones among us, and we reviled him and threw things at him. heendured both being struck and insulted without a word, though he wasin his own house; but when the will of aegis-bearing jove inspiredhim, he and telemachus took the armour and hid it in an inner chamber,bolting the doors behind them. then he cunningly made his wife offerhis bow and a quantity of iron to be contended for by us ill-fatedsuitors; and this was the beginning of our end, for not one of uscould string the bow- nor nearly do so. when it was about to reach thehands of ulysses, we all of us shouted out that it should not be givenhim, no matter what he might say, but telemachus insisted on hishaving it. when he had got it in his hands he strung it with easeand sent his arrow through the iron. then he stood on the floor of thecloister and poured his arrows on the ground, glaring fiercely abouthim. first he killed antinous, and then, aiming straight before him,he let fly his deadly darts and they fell thick on one another. it wasplain that some one of the gods was helping them, for they fell uponus with might and main throughout the cloisters, and there was ahideous sound of groaning as our brains were being battered in, andthe ground seethed with our blood. this, agamemnon, is how we cameby our end, and our bodies are lying still un-cared for in the houseof ulysses, for our friends at home do not yet know what has happened,so that they cannot lay us out and wash the black blood from ourwounds, making moan over us according to the offices due to thedeparted."
"happy ulysses, son of laertes," replied the ghost of agamemnon,"you are indeed blessed in the possession of a wife endowed withsuch rare excellence of understanding, and so faithful to her weddedlord as penelope the daughter of icarius. the fame, therefore, ofher virtue shall never die, and the immortals shall compose a songthat shall be welcome to all mankind in honour of the constancy ofpenelope. how far otherwise was the wickedness of the daughter oftyndareus who killed her lawful husband; her song shall be hatefulamong men, for she has brought disgrace on all womankind even on thegood ones."
thus did they converse in the house of hades deep down within thebowels of the earth. meanwhile ulysses and the others passed out ofthe town and soon reached the fair and well-tilled farm of laertes,which he had reclaimed with infinite labour. here was his house,with a lean-to running all round it, where the slaves who worked forhim slept and sat and ate, while inside the house there was an oldsicel woman, who looked after him in this his country-farm. whenulysses got there, he said to his son and to the other two:
"go to the house, and kill the best pig that you can find fordinner. meanwhile i want to see whether my father will know me, orfail to recognize me after so long an absence."
he then took off his armour and gave it to eumaeus and philoetius,who went straight on to the house, while he turned off into thevineyard to make trial of his father. as he went down into the greatorchard, he did not see dolius, nor any of his sons nor of the otherbondsmen, for they were all gathering thorns to make a fence for thevineyard, at the place where the old man had told them; he thereforefound his father alone, hoeing a vine. he had on a dirty old shirt,patched and very shabby; his legs were bound round with thongs ofoxhide to save him from the brambles, and he also wore sleeves ofleather; he had a goat skin cap on his head, and was looking verywoe-begone. when ulysses saw him so worn, so old and full of sorrow,he stood still under a tall pear tree and began to weep. he doubtedwhether to embrace him, kiss him, and tell him all about his havingcome home, or whether he should first question him and see what hewould say. in the end he deemed it best to be crafty with him, so inthis mind he went up to his father, who was bending down and diggingabout a plant.
"i see, sir," said ulysses, "that you are an excellent gardener-what pains you take with it, to be sure. there is not a singleplant, not a fig tree, vine, olive, pear, nor flower bed, but bearsthe trace of your attention. i trust, however, that you will not beoffended if i say that you take better care of your garden than ofyourself. you are old, unsavoury, and very meanly clad. it cannot bebecause you are idle that your master takes such poor care of you,indeed your face and figure have nothing of the slave about them,and proclaim you of noble birth. i should have said that you wereone of those who should wash well, eat well, and lie soft at nightas old men have a right to do; but tell me, and tell me true, whosebondman are you, and in whose garden are you working? tell me alsoabout another matter. is this place that i have come to really ithaca?i met a man just now who said so, but he was a dull fellow, and hadnot the patience to hear my story out when i was asking him about anold friend of mine, whether he was still living, or was already deadand in the house of hades. believe me when i tell you that this mancame to my house once when i was in my own country and never yet didany stranger come to me whom i liked better. he said that his familycame from ithaca and that his father was laertes, son of arceisius.i received him hospitably, making him welcome to all the abundanceof my house, and when he went away i gave him all customarypresents. i gave him seven talents of fine gold, and a cup of solidsilver with flowers chased upon it. i gave him twelve light cloaks,and as many pieces of tapestry; i also gave him twelve cloaks ofsingle fold, twelve rugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal numberof shirts. to all this i added four good looking women skilled inall useful arts, and i let him take his choice."
his father shed tears and answered, "sir, you have indeed come tothe country that you have named, but it is fallen into the hands ofwicked people. all this wealth of presents has been given to nopurpose. if you could have found your friend here alive in ithaca,he would have entertained you hospitably and would have requiredyour presents amply when you left him- as would have been only rightconsidering what you have already given him. but tell me, and tellme true, how many years is it since you entertained this guest- myunhappy son, as ever was? alas! he has perished far from his owncountry; the fishes of the sea have eaten him, or he has fallen a preyto the birds and wild beasts of some continent. neither his mother,nor i his father, who were his parents, could throw our arms about himand wrap him in his shroud, nor could his excellent and richly doweredwife penelope bewail her husband as was natural upon his death bed,and close his eyes according to the offices due to the departed. butnow, tell me truly for i want to know. who and whence are you- tell meof your town and parents? where is the ship lying that has brought youand your men to ithaca? or were you a passenger on some other man'sship, and those who brought you here have gone on their way and leftyou?"
"i will tell you everything," answered ulysses, "quite truly. i comefrom alybas, where i have a fine house. i am son of king apheidas, whois the son of polypemon. my own name is eperitus; heaven drove meoff my course as i was leaving sicania, and i have been carried hereagainst my will. as for my ship it is lying over yonder, off theopen country outside the town, and this is the fifth year sinceulysses left my country. poor fellow, yet the omens were good forhim when he left me. the birds all flew on our right hands, and bothhe and i rejoiced to see them as we parted, for we had every hope thatwe should have another friendly meeting and exchange presents."
a dark cloud of sorrow fell upon laertes as he listened. he filledboth hands with the dust from off the ground and poured it over hisgrey head, groaning heavily as he did so. the heart of ulysses wastouched, and his nostrils quivered as he looked upon his father;then he sprang towards him, flung his arms about him and kissed him,saying, "i am he, father, about whom you are asking- i have returnedafter having been away for twenty years. but cease your sighing andlamentation- we have no time to lose, for i should tell you that ihave been killing the suitors in my house, to punish them for theirinsolence and crimes."
"if you really are my son ulysses," replied laertes, "and havecome back again, you must give me such manifest proof of your identityas shall convince me."
"first observe this scar," answered ulysses, "which i got from aboar's tusk when i was hunting on mount parnassus. you and my motherhad sent me to autolycus, my mother's father, to receive thepresents which when he was over here he had promised to give me.furthermore i will point out to you the trees in the vineyard whichyou gave me, and i asked you all about them as i followed you roundthe garden. we went over them all, and you told me their names andwhat they all were. you gave me thirteen pear trees, ten appletrees, and forty fig trees; you also said you would give me fifty rowsof vines; there was corn planted between each row, and they yieldgrapes of every kind when the heat of heaven has been laid heavyupon them."
laertes' strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofswhich his son had given him. he threw his arms about him, andulysses had to support him, or he would have gone off into a swoon;but as soon as he came to, and was beginning to recover his senses, hesaid, "o father jove, then you gods are still in olympus after all, ifthe suitors have really been punished for their insolence and folly.nevertheless, i am much afraid that i shall have all the townspeopleof ithaca up here directly, and they will be sending messengerseverywhere throughout the cities of the cephallenians."
ulysses answered, "take heart and do not trouble yourself aboutthat, but let us go into the house hard by your garden. i have alreadytold telemachus, philoetius, and eumaeus to go on there and get dinnerready as soon as possible."
thus conversing the two made their way towards the house. whenthey got there they found telemachus with the stockman and theswineherd cutting up meat and mixing wine with water. then the oldsicel woman took laertes inside and washed him and anointed him withoil. she put him on a good cloak, and minerva came up to him andgave him a more imposing presence, making him taller and stouterthan before. when he came back his son was surprised to see himlooking so like an immortal, and said to him, "my dear father, someone of the gods has been making you much taller and better-looking."
laertes answered, "would, by father jove, minerva, and apollo,that i were the man i was when i ruled among the cephallenians, andtook nericum, that strong fortress on the foreland. if i were stillwhat i then was and had been in our house yesterday with my armour on,i should have been able to stand by you and help you against thesuitors. i should have killed a great many of them, and you would haverejoiced to see it."
thus did they converse; but the others, when they had finished theirwork and the feast was ready, left off working, and took each hisproper place on the benches and seats. then they began eating; byand by old dolius and his sons left their work and came up, fortheir mother, the sicel woman who looked after laertes now that he wasgrowing old, had been to fetch them. when they saw ulysses and werecertain it was he, they stood there lost in astonishment; butulysses scolded them good-naturedly and said, "sit down to yourdinner, old man, and never mind about your surprise; we have beenwanting to begin for some time and have been waiting for you."
then dolius put out both his hands and went up to ulysses. "sir,"said he, seizing his master's hand and kissing it at the wrist, "wehave long been wishing you home: and now heaven has restored you to usafter we had given up hoping. all hail, therefore, and may the godsprosper you. but tell me, does penelope already know of your return,or shall we send some one to tell her?"
"old man," answered ulysses, "she knows already, so you need nottrouble about that." on this he took his seat, and the sons ofdolius gathered round ulysses to give him greeting and embrace him oneafter the other; then they took their seats in due order near doliustheir father.
while they were thus busy getting their dinner ready, rumour wentround the town, and noised abroad the terrible fate that hadbefallen the suitors; as soon, therefore, as the people heard of itthey gathered from every quarter, groaning and hooting before thehouse of ulysses. they took the dead away, buried every man his own,and put the bodies of those who came from elsewhere on board thefishing vessels, for the fishermen to take each of them to his ownplace. they then met angrily in the place of assembly, and when theywere got together eupeithes rose to speak. he was overwhelmed withgrief for the death of his son antinous, who had been the first mankilled by ulysses, so he said, weeping bitterly, "my friend, thisman has done the achaeans great wrong. he took many of our best menaway with him in his fleet, and he has lost both ships and men; now,moreover, on his return he has been killing all the foremost men amongthe cephallenians. let us be up and doing before he can get away topylos or to elis where the epeans rule, or we shall be ashamed ofourselves for ever afterwards. it will be an everlasting disgrace tous if we do not avenge the murder of our sons and brothers. for my ownpart i should have no mote pleasure in life, but had rather die atonce. let us be up, then, and after them, before they can cross overto the mainland."
he wept as he spoke and every one pitied him. but medon and the bardphemius had now woke up, and came to them from the house of ulysses.every one was astonished at seeing them, but they stood in themiddle of the assembly, and medon said, "hear me, men of ithaca.ulysses did not do these things against the will of heaven. i myselfsaw an immortal god take the form of mentor and stand beside him. thisgod appeared, now in front of him encouraging him, and now goingfuriously about the court and attacking the suitors whereon theyfell thick on one another."
on this pale fear laid hold of them, and old halitherses, son ofmastor, rose to speak, for he was the only man among them who knewboth past and future; so he spoke to them plainly and in allhonesty, saying,
"men of ithaca, it is all your own fault that things have turned outas they have; you would not listen to me, nor yet to mentor, when webade you check the folly of your sons who were doing much wrong in thewantonness of their hearts- wasting the substance and dishonouring thewife of a chieftain who they thought would not return. now, however,let it be as i say, and do as i tell you. do not go out againstulysses, or you may find that you have been drawing down evil onyour own heads."
this was what he said, and more than half raised a loud shout, andat once left the assembly. but the rest stayed where they were, forthe speech of halitherses displeased them, and they sided witheupeithes; they therefore hurried off for their armour, and whenthey had armed themselves, they met together in front of the city, andeupeithes led them on in their folly. he thought he was going toavenge the murder of his son, whereas in truth he was never to return,but was himself to perish in his attempt.
then minerva said to jove, "father, son of saturn, king of kings,answer me this question- what do you propose to do? will you setthem fighting still further, or will you make peace between them?"
and jove answered, "my child, why should you ask me? was it not byyour own arrangement that ulysses came home and took his revengeupon the suitors? do whatever you like, but i will tell you what ithink will be most reasonable arrangement. now that ulysses isrevenged, let them swear to a solemn covenant, in virtue of which heshall continue to rule, while we cause the others to forgive andforget the massacre of their sons and brothers. let them then allbecome friends as heretofore, and let peace and plenty reign."
this was what minerva was already eager to bring about, so downshe darted from off the topmost summits of olympus.
now when laertes and the others had done dinner, ulysses began bysaying, "some of you go out and see if they are not getting close upto us." so one of dolius's sons went as he was bid. standing on thethreshold he could see them all quite near, and said to ulysses, "herethey are, let us put on our armour at once."
they put on their armour as fast as they could- that is to sayulysses, his three men, and the six sons of dolius. laertes also anddolius did the same- warriors by necessity in spite of their greyhair. when they had all put on their armour, they opened the gateand sallied forth, ulysses leading the way.
then jove's daughter minerva came up to them, having assumed theform and voice of mentor. ulysses was glad when he saw her, and saidto his son telemachus, "telemachus, now that are about to fight inan engagement, which will show every man's mettle, be sure not todisgrace your ancestors, who were eminent for their strength andcourage all the world over."
"you say truly, my dear father," answered telemachus, "and you shallsee, if you will, that i am in no mind to disgrace your family."
laertes was delighted when he heard this. "good heavens, heexclaimed, "what a day i am enjoying: i do indeed rejoice at it. myson and grandson are vying with one another in the matter of valour."
on this minerva came close up to him and said, "son of arceisius-best friend i have in the world- pray to the blue-eyed damsel, andto jove her father; then poise your spear and hurl it."
as she spoke she infused fresh vigour into him, and when he hadprayed to her he poised his spear and hurled it. he hit eupeithes'helmet, and the spear went right through it, for the helmet stayedit not, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily tothe ground. meantime ulysses and his son fell the front line of thefoe and smote them with their swords and spears; indeed, they wouldhave killed every one of them, and prevented them from ever gettinghome again, only minerva raised her voice aloud, and made every onepause. "men of ithaca," she cried, cease this dreadful war, and settlethe matter at once without further bloodshed."
on this pale fear seized every one; they were so frightened thattheir arms dropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at thesound of the goddess's voice, and they fled back to the city for theirlives. but ulysses gave a great cry, and gathering himself togetherswooped down like a soaring eagle. then the son of saturn sent athunderbolt of fire that fell just in front of minerva, so she said toulysses, "ulysses, noble son of laertes, stop this warful strife, orjove will be angry with you."
thus spoke minerva, and ulysses obeyed her gladly. then minervaassumed the form and voice of mentor, and presently made a covenant ofpeace between the two contending parties.
